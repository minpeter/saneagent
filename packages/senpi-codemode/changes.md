# senpi-codemode fork changes

## 2026-09-09 - Eval description teaches cell mechanics; routing moved to the presets

### What changed

- `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts`: every dialect block (`<eval_first_batching>`, `<gpt_eval_dialect>`, codex, kimi, default) drops the "default execution surface / one cell per multi-call step / never a chain / return ONLY distilled facts" wording and keeps mechanics: batch a step's independent calls in one cell with `parallel(thunks)`, write real code around them, keep every failed or missing item in the result verbatim, re-read truncated output before deciding, and (with monitor) start long-running work through `tool.monitor`. `BATCHING_GUIDELINES` are one-line pointers without capitals. The routing decision (what is batched, what runs one at a time and is observed) now lives once, in the model's preset.
- `test/prompt.test.ts`: the guideline equality uses the new default line; dialect markers are checked by tag and by shape (no all-caps words of five or more letters in the Kimi instruction, no `NEVER` in the default instruction) instead of pinned slogans.

### Why

- The same instruction rendered in three homes per session (tool description, preset rule, system guideline). Prompt-engineering skill: one home per rule; the description is the right home for mechanics because it renders for every model, the preset for routing because that wording is per model. Distilled-only returns hid the detail the next step needed in 14% of sampled cells (2026-09-09 census), so the description now names the failure-verbatim rule instead of "return ONLY distilled facts". o200k: default 1396 -> 1278, claude 1390 -> 1291, kimi 1397 -> 1277, codex/gpt 1325 -> 1321.

## 2026-09-07 - Bun.spawnSync inherits the pinned session environment

### What changed

- `src/kernels/js/worker-shell-capture.js` wraps `Bun.spawnSync` under the same environment pin gate as `Bun.spawn`: when a session environment was applied and the call passes no explicit `env`, the worker's `process.env` view is injected (array and object call forms); explicit `env` is left untouched and the original is restored on uninstall.

### Why

- Measured on Bun 1.4.0: a Worker's `process.env` writes are visible to `Bun. and `node:child_process` but not to `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.spawnSync` without an explicit `env`, which inherit the OS environ. The 2026-09-07 session-environment change covered `Bun.spawn` only, so a cell using `Bun.spawnSync` could still route per-session tooling (e.g. the omo ulw-loop toolkit keyed on `PI_SESSION_ID`) to the wrong scope.

### Tests

- `test/js-kernel-shell-capture.test.ts`: pinned / explicit-env / object-form `spawnSync` cases and a no-session pass-through plus restore case (fake Bun records `spawnSync` calls).
- `test/js-kernel-session-env.test.ts`: the worker + inline matrix runs a real `Bun.spawnSync` child when the cell runtime is Bun.


## 2026-09-07 - Eval kernels carry the session environment

### What changed

- New `src/kernels/session-env.ts` resolves the per-session `PI_*` environment (`PI_SESSION_ID`, `PI_SESSION_FILE`, `PI_PROVIDER`, `PI_MODEL`, `PI_REASONING_LEVEL`) from the extension session context and merges it over the inherited environment with the bash tool's delete-then-set semantics.
- `runtime-factory` resolves the environment at session start and threads it through `CreateCodemodeSessionManagerOptions.sessionEnv` into every kernel: the JS worker applies it to its own `process.env` at worker init (so `env()`, `process.env`, `Bun.$`, `Bun.spawn`, and `child_process` children all see it), and the py/rb/jl interpreters spawn with it merged into their environment (so `os.environ` and their children see it). Restarted or reset interpreters re-apply it because it is a kernel option, not a one-shot spawn side effect.
- Under Bun a `delete process.env.X` does not unsetenv, so `worker-shell-capture.js` additionally pins the worker's environment view (`$.env` seed plus explicit `env` on captured `Bun.spawn` calls without one) whenever the session environment deleted inherited keys; without this, children would still see deleted `PI_*` values in the OS environment.

### Why

- A child spawned from an eval cell saw no `PI_SESSION_ID`, so `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop` invoked from a cell resolved the cwd-global state instead of the active session — a real data-corruption path. The contract is that a child spawned from eval sees the same session environment a child spawned from the `bash` tool sees; the core exposes no importable helper for that set (its bash implementation is private and the host package is a type-only dependency here), so the five-key contract is mirrored in one documented helper.

## 2026-09-07 - Fail clearly when compiled codemode assets are missing

### What changed

- Kernel runtime asset resolution now rejects Bun virtual paths and reports the missing codemode sidecar beside the executable, while skill contribution resolution remains non-throwing.

### Why

- Compiled binaries cannot pass embedded `/$bunfs` paths to workers or subprocesses; the actionable error identifies the expected sidecar asset and deployment fix.


## 2026-09-06 - Bun eval description steers away from Bun.spawnSync

### What changed

- `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts`: the Bun runtime sentence gains one instruction after the WebView
  clause: "Shell out through `Bun.$` or `Bun.spawn`, never `Bun.spawnSync`: a synchronous child blocks
  the worker, so a stop or timeout then loses every variable."

### Why

- Session audit (#1403): models wrapped shell commands in `Bun.spawnSync` inside cells; a worker blocked
  in a synchronous call cannot honour `interrupt`, so the stop that #1406 made bounded still has to
  replace the worker and drop its globals. The model cannot derive the worker-thread limit; the async
  forms settle cooperatively and keep the kernel.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Prompt text owned by this package; no runtime behavior changed.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: fork-only description text.

## 2026-09-06 - JS kernel: cooperative interrupt, bounded stop, stdin isolation (#1403)

### What changed

- `src/kernels/js/worker-core.js`: handles the `interrupt` bridge message. It emits an
  `interrupt-ack` status at once, rejects every pending bridge `tool.*` call and any later call from
  the same cell with `CellInterruptedError` (`JS cell interrupted: <reason>`), and asks the runtime to
  kill the cell's children, so a cell parked on a bridge call or a spawned child settles without
  losing the worker.
- `src/kernels/js/worker-runtime.js`: tracks `Bun.spawn` children created during the active cell
  (forgotten when they exit or the cell ends) and kills the live ones on `interrupt()`.
- `src/kernels/js/worker-shell-capture.js` (+ `.d.ts`): while a cell is active every `Bun.$`
  template is framed as `true | (\n<template>\n)` so no command inherits the host's terminal as
  stdin; `Bun.spawn` children are reported through the new optional `onChild` hook.
- `src/kernels/js/context-manager.ts`: `interrupt()` and the kernel timeout go through
  `#stopActive` - post `interrupt`, wait for the ack (`INTERRUPT_ACK_MS`) and then the settlement
  grace (`JS_INTERRUPT_GRACE_MS`), and only replace the worker when the cell stays unsettled;
  the host-composed result (`interruptResult`) wins over the worker's own error text; a worker
  abandoned at the termination deadline gets a stderr note into the cell output. The worker
  generation moved to `src/kernels/js/worker-slot.ts` (startup with inline fallback, message
  fencing, bounded retirement) and the startup sequence to `src/kernels/js/worker-startup.ts`
  (also the new home of `resolveJsWorkerEntryUrl`, re-exported from `context-manager.ts`).
- `src/kernels/js/interrupt-bounds.ts`: `awaitCooperativeSettlement`, `retireWorker` (bounded by
  `WORKER_TERMINATE_DEADLINE_MS`), `abandonedWorkerNote`.
- `src/kernels/js/run-queue.ts`: pending runs carry `settlement`, `interruptResult`,
  `interruptAck`, `settledByWorker`; `settleAll` prefers the in-flight interrupt result.
- `src/bridge/reserved.ts`: `INTERRUPT_ACK_OP`.
- `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts`: `stop` and the hard limit cancel through `#cancel`, which
  parks the completion notification (`interruptOutcome`) until the kernel reported whether state
  survived and keeps the handle's `note`; the public snapshot/notifier/options interfaces moved to
  `src/tool/detached-cell-contract.ts` (re-exported) and the status/wake-source projections to
  `src/tool/detached-cell-status.ts`; `src/tool/detached-notification-queue.ts` awaits async
  snapshots; `src/tool/detached-cell-snapshot.ts` and `src/tool/detached-eval-result.ts` carry
  `interruptNote` into the stop result.
- `src/tool/cell-execution.ts` + `src/tool/interrupt-note.ts`: the foreground timeout path keeps the
  whole interrupt handle (`interruptHandle`) so `describeTimeoutState` can wait for a bounded stop
  and append the kernel's note; `src/tool/types.ts` adds the optional `note` to
  `KernelInterruptHandle`.
- `src/tool/detached-cell-notification.ts`: the state note comes from `interruptionStateNote` /
  `unknownInterruptionStateNote` (`src/tool/interrupt-note.ts`) instead of a per-language constant.

### Why

- Audit of 30k eval calls (#1403): `stop` on a worker blocked in `Bun.spawnSync` hung the tool call
  (51 min in production) because `worker.terminate()` had no deadline; `Bun.$` inherited the TUI's
  stdin so `cat`, ssh/git prompts, and keychain dialogs blocked cells forever; every interrupt or
  timeout wiped the VM and the note claimed the worker was "unresponsive" without ever asking it.
  Python already preserves state on SIGINT; JavaScript now matches it where the cell can settle and
  tells the truth where it cannot.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Interrupt delivery, worker lifecycle, and the shell wrapper live inside the kernel package's
  worker protocol; no extension can reach the worker thread or the run queue.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `src/kernels/js/context-manager.ts` was split; an upstream change to worker startup or
  interrupt lands in `worker-slot.ts` / `worker-startup.ts` / `interrupt-bounds.ts` now.
- LOW: `worker-core.js`, `worker-runtime.js`, `worker-shell-capture.js`, `detached-cell-*.ts`.

## 2026-09-05 - GPT eval dialect routes waits through tool.monitor

### What changed

- `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts`: in `<gpt_eval_dialect>` the `tool.monitor` line moves ahead of the
  detach line and reads "A wait or a long run (build, test run, deploy, watch) starts through
  `tool.monitor({ command, filter })` in that same cell with the decisive-line filter; its event wakes
  the turn, so no cell sits on the wait and no child is spawned for it." The detach sentence is
  unchanged and now describes computation cells. The GPT batching guideline (the line senpi renders
  under `## Tool Guidelines`) becomes monitor-aware: with `monitor` reachable it reads "Use eval to
  compose tool work in one cell; a wait or a long run starts through `tool.monitor` in that cell, so
  no cell sits on it and nothing polls."; without it the previous detach wording stays.
- `test/prompt.test.ts`: pins the monitor-aware guideline copy for `gpt-5.6` with `monitor: true`,
  and that the gpt description names `tool.monitor(` before "detach on timeout" and carries "no cell
  sits on the wait". Existing gating and dialect assertions are unchanged.

### Why

- The GPT guideline said "long cells detach on timeout and notify on completion, so do not poll" -
  the only wait mechanism the system prompt named for GPT models, while the subscription route lived
  three lines down in the tool description. A multi-round backtest against the real `gpt-6-astra`
  (eval-only tool shape) showed the consequence on a CI-then-merge request: 2 of 3 samples awaited
  `gh pr checks --watch` through `Bun.spawn` inside a cell, a form the guideline sanctioned. Two routes
  for one situation is the contradiction the GPT-5.6 guide warns about; the guideline now names the
  route, the description states the cost once (a cell that waits holds the kernel; a child spawned
  to watch burns a session), and the detach fact stays as mechanics rather than advice.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently

- Prompt text owned by this package; no runtime behavior changed.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: fork-only dialect text and its test.

## 2026-09-04 - eval tool description diet, second pass

### What changed

- `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts`: the `Fields:` block is gone; the description names the enabled
  `language` values and defers every per-field rule (`summary`, `timeout`, `on_timeout`, `reset`,
  `action`) to the parameter schema, which already carries each of them. The detach paragraph is one
  sentence pair (what detaches, how to peek/stop). Helper doc lines drop restated words but keep every
  signature; the `<workflow>` block keeps the graph rules in one sentence each. The `jl` handle form
  now gets a separator when it follows `py`/`js` (`/ \`handle=true\``), fixing a fused
  `}\`\`handle=true\`` render that the all-languages snapshot had pinned.
- `test/prompt.test.ts` + snapshot: the field-semantics test now asserts the schema is the single home
  (no `- \`timeout\``/`\`on_timeout\`` in the description) and that the guideline still states reset
  scope; the handle-form test gains the four-language case and rejects the fused `jl` form.

### Why

- After the first diet the gpt/codex dialect still rendered 1,489 o200k tokens (description +
  guidelines, py+js, spawns). The `Fields:` list restated the parameter schema word for word (198
  tokens of schema text billed twice), and the detach/busy-kernel text said the same thing in three
  places. Every deleted sentence has a surviving home; no helper signature or dialect block changed.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The description is built inside this package's `buildEvalPrompt`; there is no hook that lets an
  outer extension shorten a tool description it does not own.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `EVAL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` prose and the three snapshot files. Upstream pi has no codemode
  package, so the zone is fork-only.

## 2026-09-04 - eval tool description diet

### What changed

- `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts`: dropped `REUSE_CHAIN_EXAMPLES` (three embedded JSON call examples), collapsed the `<workflow>` block to one dense rule sentence, merged the three state-persistence restatements into one, tightened the timeout/on_timeout/hard-limit/detach prose, and removed the per-dialect "sleeping/timed retries are not waiting" clause from the monitor bullets (the terminal section owns that doctrine). Helper signatures and dialect selection are unchanged. Fixed the workflow block's fused `handle=True{ handle: true }` into per-language correct forms.
- `test/prompt.test.ts`: removed the reuse-chain filter test (its subject is gone), added the handle-form regression test, regenerated snapshots.

### Why

- The description cost ~2.0k tokens on every eval-enabled turn; the cuts are content the model already does by default or that the terminal section states. codex dialect 2002 -> 1588, claude 2058 -> 1648, kimi 2073 -> 1668, default 2079 -> 1668 (o200k).

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `eval-prompt.ts` template and the prompt snapshots; regenerate snapshots rather than merging.


## eval foreground window caps the interactive detach budget (2026-09-04)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/config/settings.ts` adds `foregroundWindowSeconds` to the settings schema, `CodemodeSettings`, `defaultCodemodeSettings` (`60`), and `mergeSettings`, plus `DEFAULT_FOREGROUND_WINDOW_SECONDS`, `FOREGROUND_WINDOW_ENVIRONMENT_FLAG` (`SENPI_CODEMODE_FOREGROUND_SECONDS`), and `resolveForegroundWindowSeconds()` mirroring the hard-limit resolver.
- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/tool/eval-tool.ts` computes the timeout behavior first, then clamps the detach watchdog budget to `min(timeout ?? cellTimeoutSeconds, foregroundWindowSeconds)` only when the behavior is `"detach"`; `"error"` keeps the unclamped deadline. The wall-clock hard limit (`max(hardLimitSeconds, timeout)`) is untouched.
- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/tool/eval-tool-options.ts` adds the optional `foregroundWindowSeconds` factory option; `packages/senpi-codemode/src/index.ts` passes `resolveForegroundWindowSeconds(...)` at both eval registration sites.
- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts` and `packages/senpi-codemode/src/tool/types.ts` document that `timeout` is the detach budget capped at the foreground window and that a larger value extends the hard limit, not the foreground block.

### Why

- A real session passed `timeout: 7000` to keep a long detached orchestration cell alive; because `timeout` had no cap it blocked the agent loop for ~2h and then hit the 7000s hard limit, killing the cell and restarting the kernel. The bash tool already separates a 60s foreground window from the kill deadline; eval had no equivalent, so `timeout` did the worst of both worlds.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The detach-vs-error decision and the idle watchdog budget are computed inside this package's `runEvalCell`; no downstream hook can re-cap the detach timer before the cell is scheduled, and the setting must live in this package's settings schema and registration path.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `src/config/settings.ts` around the settings schema, defaults, and resolver functions.
- LOW in `src/tool/eval-tool.ts` around the `timeoutMs` computation in `runEvalCell`.
- LOW in `src/index.ts` at the two `createEvalTool` registration sites.
- LOW in `src/tool/types.ts` and `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts` around the `timeout`/`on_timeout` descriptions.


## Eval description subscribes to monitor events when available (2026-09-03)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts` adds a capability-gated monitor-subscription bullet to each emphasis dialect and folds filter/join/aggregate wording into the existing result-reduction bullets.
- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/tool/eval-tool-options.ts` carries the optional `monitor` capability, and `packages/senpi-codemode/src/tool/eval-tool.ts` forwards it to prompt construction.
- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/index.ts` detects `monitor` in `pi.getAllTools()` for session-runtime eval registration; the pre-extension fallback registration passes `false` deliberately because monitor is not loaded yet.
- `packages/senpi-codemode/test/prompt.test.ts` asserts both gated directions across all five dialects, and `packages/senpi-codemode/test/__snapshots__/prompt.test.ts.snap` records the intentional result-reduction wording change.

### Why

- With monitor reachable only through an eval cell, the eval description is the only model-facing surface that can teach the callable `tool.monitor({ command, filter })` form and the event-driven wait stance without naming an unavailable tool. The existing monitor rule is being removed from the preset, so this compact addition preserves the contract while consolidating result reduction.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The description is composed by the eval tool factory before the model can invoke a cell; an external extension cannot add a capability-gated instruction to that tool's registered description or change its dialect rendering.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts` around the dialect template, `src/tool/eval-tool-options.ts` and `src/tool/eval-tool.ts` around prompt options, and `src/index.ts` around baseline/session-runtime eval registration.

## Bun child-process output stays inside the JS cell (2026-09-03)

### What changed

- New `src/kernels/js/worker-shell-capture.js` (+ `.d.ts`): `installShellCapture({ isActive, emitText })` replaces `Bun.$` and `Bun.spawn` on the worker's `Bun` global. While a cell is active, every `Bun.$` promise is switched to native quiet mode before its command starts and its captured stdout/stderr are echoed once into the cell's `text` stream when it settles — unless the cell reads it through `.quiet()`/`.text()`/`.json()`/`.lines()`/`.arrayBuffer()`/`.bytes()`/`.blob()`, which Bun itself keeps silent. Shell-level `env`/`cwd`/`nothrow`/`throws` chain on the captured shell; the `Shell`/`ShellPromise`/`ShellError`/`braces`/`escape` statics are carried over. `Bun.spawn` calls that leave `stderr` at its default get `stderr: "pipe"` and the pipe is drained into the cell's stderr stream; explicit `stderr`/`stdio` choices pass through. Outside an active cell both surfaces behave exactly as before (inline-worker mode shares the host globals). On Node the installer is a no-op.
- `src/kernels/js/worker-runtime.js` installs the capture beside the existing `console`/`process.stdout.write` routing and restores it from `__senpi_restore_console__`.
- `test/js-kernel-shell-capture.test.ts` pins the contract against a fake that mirrors the verified Bun 1.4 `ShellPromise` behavior (lazy start on `then`, internal quiet for the read methods, same-object chaining); `test/js-kernel-shell-capture-bun.test.ts` runs the real kernel under `bun` (skipped when `bun` is absent) and asserts the markers never reach the driver's fd 1/2.

### Why

- Bun's shell streams a command's output to the process' fd 1/2 unless `.quiet()` is applied or the output is read through a `.text()`-style helper (verified on bun 1.4.0: `await Bun.$\`echo x\`.nothrow()` prints `x` to stdout AND captures it), and `Bun.spawn` defaults `stderr` to `inherit`. Inside the JS kernel those fds are the interactive TUI's terminal, so a cell doing `await $\`vibe-notion page get … --pretty\`.nothrow().then(r => r.stdout)` dumped the whole pretty-printed JSON onto the screen (observed 2026-09-03: a Notion page's block JSON landed in the user's editor and was pasted into the next prompt). The existing `routeWrite` only intercepts JS-level `process.stdout.write`; native child-output writes bypass it.
- Echoing the captured output into the cell instead of only silencing it keeps Bun's documented "the output is visible" semantics at the correct sink, consistent with how `console.log` is routed today.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The worker's `Bun` global and the cell-activity gate (`#hooks`) live inside this package's worker runtime; nothing outside the worker can wrap `Bun.$` before a cell's first `then` or attribute an emission to the running cell.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `src/kernels/js/worker-runtime.js` around `#installGlobals` (import plus install/restore lines).
- NONE for the new module and tests.
## Binary skill resolution and stdout-safe miss reporting (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/extension/skill-contribution.ts` resolves the bundled
  `bun-1-4` SKILL.md through `resolveCodemodeRuntimeAsset`, so a compiled binary falls
  back to the sidecar at
  `node_modules/@code-yeongyu/senpi-codemode/src/skill/bun-1-4/SKILL.md` next to the
  executable instead of only probing the embedded module-relative path.
- The "skill not found" notice moves from `console.debug` to `console.error`.
- `test/bun-skill-contribution.test.ts` pins both contracts: sidecar resolution in a
  compiled-binary layout, and stderr-only reporting with stdout untouched.

### Why

- The compiled binary has no readable module-relative asset, so the skill was silently
  skipped for every binary user, and the notice was written to stdout - the same stream
  that carries the RPC JSONL protocol. `scripts/smoke-standalone-binary.mjs` parses that
  stream and failed with `received malformed RPC output`, which failed the `Build binaries`
  job of `build-binaries.yml` and skipped its final `Dispatch publish-npm.yml` job. Both
  the v2026.9.2 and v2026.9.2-2 tag runs failed this way, so neither release reached npm.
- The Ruby and Julia kernel runners already resolve their assets through the same sidecar
  helper; this brings the skill asset onto that established path.

## Eval QA owns its temporary agent directory (2026-08-30)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/scripts/qa-e2e-eval.ts` now always creates its own
  temporary agent directory instead of reusing an inherited
  `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.
- `test/qa-e2e-eval-sandbox.test.ts` runs the real QA driver with an external
  sentinel agent directory and proves the directory remains unchanged after
  the driver exits.

### Why

- A QA command launched from an active Senpi or branded Omo session inherits
  the live runtime's agent directory. The driver previously treated that path
  as QA-owned scratch space, wrote test settings into it, and recursively
  removed it during cleanup.
- In the observed incident, deleting the live sessions directory made the
  running UI appear to open a new session. The surviving processes recreated
  headerless JSONL fragments, so the resume picker no longer found the recent
  sessions.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The destructive path selection and cleanup happen in the standalone QA
  driver before extension behavior can impose a filesystem boundary. The
  driver itself must create and own the paths it removes.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `scripts/qa-e2e-eval.ts` around sandbox setup and cleanup.
- LOW in the new focused QA sandbox regression test.

## Compiled eval kernels resolve runtime assets from the sidecar (2026-08-27)

### What changed

- JavaScript worker entries and the Python prelude now resolve through the compiled-runtime sidecar, matching the existing Ruby and Julia kernel behavior.
- Added coverage for all three assets in the compiled runner path tests.

### Why

- Bun-compiled eval kernels received `$bunfs` paths that are not usable by `Worker` or an external `python3` process. The staged sidecar provides real filesystem paths next to the compiled executable.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in the JavaScript and Python kernel asset resolution paths and compiled runner path tests.

## Session teardown failures stay out of lifecycle handler rejections (2026-08-25)

### What changed

- `SessionManagerProxy` catches inner-manager `dispose()` failures in `replace()` and `dispose()` and routes them through an injectable reporter (default: one `[senpi-codemode] session teardown failed: …` stderr line, AggregateError causes inlined) instead of propagating them to the caller.
- `test/session-manager-proxy.test.ts` pins the contract: a replacement installs even when the outgoing manager's dispose rejects, `dispose()` resolves while reporting the failure, and a superseded replacement's dispose failure is contained.

### Why

- A kernel that misses its post-SIGKILL reap window (500ms in `subprocess-process.ts`) makes `subprocess-kernel.close()` throw `KernelRetirementError`; `DefaultCodemodeSessionManager` aggregates it into `Failed to dispose codemode session manager`, and the rejected `session_shutdown`/`session_before_switch` handler surfaced as a user-facing `extension_error` warning in RPC hosts (observed as a Work Log warning row in the omo desktop app). Teardown is best-effort — the interpreter is already SIGKILLed — so the failure is diagnostics, not a session error.
- The inner manager keeps its throwing dispose contract (pinned in `session-manager-lifecycle.test.ts`); only the proxy boundary that lifecycle handlers call absorbs it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `src/extension/session-manager-proxy.ts` around `replace()`/`dispose()`.

## Detached-eval spill notices carry absolute paths (2026-08-23)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/tool/detached-cell-notification.ts` now writes the plain absolute spill path into the oversized-output notice (`Buffered output overflowed; full output: <absolute path>`) instead of a `local://…` URI. The `localUri` helper and the unused `artifactsDir` parameter on `buildDetachedCellNotification` are gone; `DetachedNotificationQueue` no longer stores `artifactsDir`.
- `test/eval-detach.test.ts` locks the contract: the notice must contain `join(artifactsDir, "local", "detached-eval-<id>.log")` and must not contain `local://`.

### Why

- `local://` is a kernel-helper scheme resolved from the session artifact root inside eval cells (`read()`/`write()` prelude helpers). The agent-facing `read` tool resolves plain paths only, so a model that followed the notice's `local://detached-eval-<id>.log` got `ENOENT: <cwd>/local:/detached-eval-<id>.log`. This reproduces the documented invariant: spill notices contain plain absolute paths, not a custom URI scheme.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The spill notice text is composed inside this package's notification builder; no downstream hook can rewrite the notice before it is queued to the notifier.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `src/tool/detached-cell-notification.ts` around the spill-notice composition and the removed helper.
- LOW in `src/tool/detached-notification-queue.ts` around the constructor and flush mapping.
- LOW in `test/eval-detach.test.ts` around the crash-spill assertions.

## Detached-cell notices deliver as internal custom messages (2026-08-23)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/extension/eval-notifier.ts` now delivers detached-cell completion notices through `sendMessage` with the new `EVAL_NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_TYPE` (`senpi-codemode:notification`) and `display: false`, instead of `sendUserMessage`. Wake/next-turn mode still selects `steer` vs `followUp`, and delivery stays once-per-cell per session generation.
- `CodemodeExtensionAPI` requires `sendMessage` in place of `sendUserMessage`; the host binding forwards to `pi.sendMessage`.

### Why

- `sendUserMessage` enqueues into the same steering queue that holds real user input, and that queue carries no provenance. A host projecting it (the OmO desktop composer) rendered the raw `<system-reminder>Detached eval cell ... cancelled.` notice under its STEERING heading as if the user had typed and queued it.
- The sibling injectors already solved this: terminal (`senpi-terminal:notification`), monitor (`senpi-monitor:notification`), and loop-guard notices all use `sendMessage` with a `customType`, documented as "deliver a model-visible notification without rendering synthetic user input". The eval notifier was the sole caller still using the user-input door, so this aligns it with the existing contract rather than adding a new mechanism.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The notifier is owned by this package and constructed during its extension factory wiring; the delivery door it calls is chosen inside `senpiCodemode`, so no downstream extension can redirect it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `src/extension/eval-notifier.ts` around the deps interface and the notify body.
- LOW in `src/index.ts` around the `CodemodeExtensionAPI` surface and the notifier construction.
- LOW in the codemode test fakes that implement the host API surface.

## Subprocess readiness gates cell execution (2026-08-21)

### What changed

- `packages/senpi-codemode/src/kernels/shared/subprocess-kernel.ts` now keeps Ruby and Julia cells queued until the active subprocess emits `ready`; only then does it write the `run` frame and arm that cell's timeout.
- An `init-failed` frame now fails queued work immediately as a kernel startup error instead of leaving it to an unrelated cell timeout.

### Why

- The shared kernel previously sent `init` and immediately started the first cell's timeout without observing readiness. Under load, interpreter and prelude startup could consume the entire cell budget, time out the state-setting cell, restart into a clean process, and make the following state-read cell fail nondeterministically.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Subprocess generation ownership, protocol readiness, run queue dispatch, and timeout arming are private to the shared kernel implementation; an extension cannot safely order those lifecycle transitions from outside the package.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `packages/senpi-codemode/src/kernels/shared/subprocess-kernel.ts` around process startup and protocol-message dispatch.
- LOW in the Ruby subprocess lifecycle tests that now emit the protocol readiness event explicitly.

## Eval completion throughput badge (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- Final single-cell eval frames now append the exact initiated nested tool-call count, a two-decimal
  calls-per-second rate, and true wall-clock elapsed time to the completed header, for example
  `eval py done ✓ · 2 calls · 1.00 calls/s · 2s · timeout 420s`.
- `EvalToolDetails` carries `wallDurationMs` and `toolCallCount` alongside the existing
  kernel-reported `durationMs`; the renderer uses wall time for final elapsed and throughput while
  preserving kernel duration for consumers that need interpreter timing.
- A cell that initiated no tool calls renders no throughput badge at all: both the count and the
  rate segments are dropped, so the header reads `eval py done ✓ · <1s` instead of
  `eval py done ✓ · 0 calls · 0.00 calls/s · <1s`. Positive calls without a positive wall duration
  render `n/a calls/s`, so the TUI never displays `Infinity` or `NaN`.
- Partial, pending, running, error, and synthetic multi-cell frames do not show a misleading final
  aggregate. The legacy no-cells result path renders the same final metadata when the new fields are
  available and preserves old output when they are absent.

### Why

- The eval extension already measures every nested tool invocation and true end-to-end wall time,
  but users could only see completion duration and per-call rows. Surfacing count and throughput in
  the final header makes eval composition efficiency observable without opening an analytics view.
- Dividing by kernel-reported duration would overstate throughput whenever host tool calls wait
  outside interpreter timing, so the visible elapsed label and the rate denominator share the same
  wall-clock source.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The completed frame is owned by the eval renderer, while exact initiated-call counts and cell
  start time are owned by the eval runtime before the generic tool result reaches any external
  extension. An external renderer cannot reconstruct both facts reliably.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `src/tool/render.ts` around `cellHeader`, `renderDetailedLines`, and final result metadata.
- LOW in `src/tool/types.ts` and `src/tool/cell-runtime.ts` around `EvalToolDetails` construction.
- LOW in eval renderer and execution-event tests.

## Eval execution metadata event (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- Every settled eval cell now publishes one versioned `senpi.eval.execution` event. The in-process
  event bus receives the full bounded payload, while the external RPC channel receives a
  metadata-only projection that excludes prompts, arguments, call ids, errors, and result previews.
- The payload records producer timestamps, true end-to-end eval wall time, kernel-reported runtime,
  terminal status, detached status, every initiated nested tool-call count (including calls still
  pending when an error cell settles), distinct tool names, and per-tool aggregate durations.
- Generic and MCP tools retain the existing 30-call enrichment cap while every call still
  contributes to exact counts and aggregates. Reserved agent/output calls now receive the same
  bounded argument and duration capture; internal schema bridge calls preserve their legacy shape.
- Captured names and identifiers are length-bounded, at most 64 distinct names receive individual
  aggregates, excess names roll into an exact overflow aggregate, and the RPC projection has a
  final 32 KiB serialized-byte ceiling with a deterministic aggregate-only fallback.
- Session-generation fencing suppresses events from retired codemode runtimes.

### Why

- OMO needs producer-side timing data to determine whether eval composition and parallel tool calls
  actually reduce round trips and wall-clock time, rather than relying on model-side assumptions.
- OMO can consume rich metadata from the in-process event bus and later publish an explicitly
  redacted or capability-gated desktop projection. The current desktop adapter decodes but ignores
  unknown extension event names, so desktop rendering remains a separate consumer change.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The eval extension owns kernel message dispatch, per-call bridge timing, bounded argument/result
  capture, detached settlement, and session-generation fencing. An external extension cannot
  reconstruct those facts accurately after the eval tool result has returned.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `src/index.ts`, `src/tool/eval-tool.ts`, and `src/tool/cell-handler.ts` around runtime
  registration, settlement, and nested tool-call capture.
- LOW in `src/tool/cell-runtime.ts`, `src/tool/eval-tool-options.ts`, and the new event builder.

## Eval cell hard limit (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- A cell now carries a wall-clock kill deadline resolved from the new `hardLimitSeconds` setting
  (default 1800s, `SENPI_CODEMODE_HARD_LIMIT_SECONDS` override), raised per call by an explicit
  larger `timeout`.
- `EvalDetachedCellManager` arms that deadline when the cell is created and clears it only on
  settlement, so it survives `detach()` and is never paused by bridge tool calls. On expiry the cell
  is interrupted, settles as cancelled, and the detached-cell notification tells the main agent it
  was killed at the hard limit.

### Why

- `cellTimeoutSeconds` only feeds the idle watchdog: `CellExecution.detach()` disposes that watchdog
  and `withBridgeTimeoutPause` pauses it for the whole duration of every host tool call, so a
  detached or tool-call-heavy cell had no upper bound at all — one observed cell ran 1h13m. The bash
  tool has enforced a kill deadline since `bash-timeout/timeout.ts`; eval now matches it.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Cell lifetime, kernel interruption, and the detached-cell notification queue all live inside the
  package; an extension cannot observe a detached cell, let alone kill it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts` around cell creation and settlement.
- LOW in `src/config/settings.ts` schema/defaults and the prompt timeout wording.

## Compiled binary runner sidecar resolution (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- Ruby and Julia kernels now preserve their normal module-relative runner path
  in source/npm execution but fall back to the standalone executable's
  `node_modules/@code-yeongyu/senpi-codemode/src/kernels/...` sidecar when the
  embedded `$bunfs` path does not exist.
- Focused tests pin Ruby, Julia, and non-compiled local-path behavior.

### Why

- The compiled coding-agent embeds the codemode factory and JavaScript
  dependency graph, but Ruby and Julia execute external runner files that Bun
  does not expose at the embedded module's `import.meta.dirname`.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Runner paths are selected inside kernel construction before user code or an
  extension wrapper can replace the subprocess arguments.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `src/kernels/rb/kernel.ts` and `src/kernels/jl/kernel.ts` runner arguments.
- `src/kernels/shared/runtime-asset.ts` compiled sidecar layout.

## Detached eval cell wake-source contract (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- The duplicated cross-package event literal is now `wake_source_state`, with source `senpi-codemode` and optional per-cell `items` metadata.
- Detached-cell detach, completion, stop, and session-dispose transitions publish the current active count through the optional host `events` passthrough; synchronous cells do not emit a lifecycle transition.
- The focused wiring suite pins event-bus delivery, completion-to-zero, bus-less compatibility, and the exact duplicated literal.

### Why

Goal continuation now aggregates every producer under one wake-source contract, so codemode must use the same event and a stable package-owned source key rather than the retired resumption-channel name.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

Detach and settlement ownership lives inside `EvalDetachedCellManager`, and only the extension entry has access to the host event bus.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `src/index.ts` and `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts` around lifecycle snapshot wiring.
- LOW in the duplicated event contract and focused tests.

## Detached eval cell resumption-channel liveness (2026-08-08)

### What changed

- New `src/extension/resumption-channel.ts` duplicates the cross-package `resumption_channel_state` event literal and
  payload type locally; senpi-codemode is a separate package and must not import from packages/coding-agent, so a
  sentinel test pins the literal to catch drift.
- `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts`: new optional `onChannelState` callback fires a full per-source snapshot
  (`{ source: "eval-detached", activeCount, channels: [{ id, description, startedAtMs }] }`) on the same transitions as
  the existing `#emitStatus` footer seam (detach / settle / stop / dispose). `description` mirrors the footer label
  fallback (`summary` else cell id). A public `publishChannelState()` re-publishes the current snapshot.
- `src/index.ts`: the local `CodemodeExtensionAPI` widens with an optional `events?: { emit(name, data) }`; emission
  goes through `pi.events?.emit(...)` so hosts without an event bus are a harmless no-op. Both cell-manager
  constructions wire the callback, and the `session_start` handler re-publishes the snapshot because the consuming
  goal builtin clears its per-session counts there.
- `test/eval-resumption-channel.test.ts`: pins the single-cell snapshot, the two-cells-settling count sequence, the
  bus-less host no-op, the `session_start` re-emit plus bus transport, and the event-name sentinel.

### Why

- The goal builtin delays its hidden "keep going" continuation while a live resumption channel is on duty, but it only
  ever learned about terminal monitors. Detached eval cells are a real live channel that reported nothing, so the goal
  nagged itself immediately at turn end while a cell was still computing. This change makes codemode EMIT its liveness;
  a sibling lane owns the consuming side in the goal builtin.
- The legacy `terminal_monitor_state` event keeps its single-owner full-snapshot semantics; emitting it from a second
  source would clobber the terminal's count, so only the new source-keyed event is used.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The liveness transitions live inside the detached-cell manager and the extension entry; an external extension cannot
  observe detach/settle/dispose without reimplementing the cell lifecycle.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `src/index.ts` around the cell-manager constructions and the `session_start` handler.
- LOW: `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts` around `#emitStatus`.
- MEDIUM: `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` when sibling lanes land entries; keep both bullets.

## Compact elapsed labels for simple eval results (2026-08-06)

### What changed

- `src/tool/render.ts`: final eval results without detailed cell records now route `durationMs` through the same compact formatter already used by cell headers, agent progress, and nested tool-call widgets.
- `test/eval-result-duration.test.ts`: focused coverage pins sub-second, seconds, minutes, and hours output plus the surrounding status/summary/phase/output frame.
- Existing renderer-state expectations now preserve the compact `<1s` label for very short completed and failed evaluations.

### Why

- The simple-result branch was the only eval duration surface that interpolated raw milliseconds, producing labels such as `took 3720000ms` while the detailed branch rendered the same duration as `1h 2m`.
- Consistent compact labels make completed tool-call timing readable without changing live footer, working-status, or thinking-duration policies.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The inconsistency lives inside the eval tool's result renderer and must be corrected at the branch that builds transcript metadata.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `src/tool/render.ts` around `resultMetadata()`.
- LOW: `test/eval-render-state.test.ts` and `test/eval-result-duration.test.ts`.

## Eval `summary` replaces `title` (2026-08-04)

### What changed

- `title` removed from the eval input surface entirely (schema, `EvalToolInput`, `EvalCellResult`, `EvalToolDetails`, renderers, detached surfaces, prompt, README, tests, QA scripts). Phase/status-event `title` is a different concept and is untouched.
- `summary` is now REQUIRED for run requests: schema property stays optional because the flat schema object is shared with the peek/stop actions, so required-ness is enforced in `parseEvalRequest` exactly like `language`/`code`, with the teaching error: `eval run requires summary — one line in the user's language: what this cell does and for what purpose`.
- The 80-char clamp runs in the `ToolDefinition`'s `prepareArguments` hook, which executes BEFORE schema validation, so an over-long summary can never become a validation error.
- The schema description carries the user-language WHAT+WHY writing guide the model reads at call time.
- Rendering: title-less header, muted summary line beneath it in transcript frames and live-update text; detached footer label is `summary ?? cellId`.
- Back-compat: callers still sending `title` keep validating (value ignored); legacy stored results (title-only details) re-render without a label and without crashing.

### Why

- `title` was decorative metadata the model rarely populated meaningfully; `summary` forces a one-line, user-language description of intent at every run, improving transcript readability and downstream debugging.
- Enforcing required-ness in the parser (not the schema) keeps the shared flat schema valid for peek/stop while still rejecting run requests that omit `summary`.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The change spans the tool schema, request parser, type definitions, renderers, detached-cell manager, status events, prompt instructions, README, and all QA scripts — a single coordinated fork commit.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `src/tool/types.ts`, `src/tool/eval-request.ts`, `src/tool/eval-tool.ts`, `src/tool/cell-runtime.ts`, `src/tool/render.ts`, `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts`, `src/tool/detached-cell-snapshot.ts`, `src/extension/eval-status.ts`, `src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts`, `README.md`, `test/`, `scripts/`.

## Backfill: persistent eval lifecycle and tool surface (2026-08-01)

### What changed

- Eval cells can detach, report state-aware timeouts, and reuse neither active nor completed detached cell IDs.
- Eval now has one normalized tool surface with bounded current-main status history and rich detached-cell peeks.
- Bridge aborts, reserved bridge routing, tool-schema feedback, and tool widgets are handled explicitly.

### Why

- Long-running eval work must remain observable, addressable, and safe across retries, timeouts, and UI rendering.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The contracts span the persistent kernel manager, bridge routing, tool schema, detached notification state, and renderer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `src/tool/eval-tool.ts`, detached cell manager/state/notification files, bridge code, status events, and eval rendering/tests.

## Live elapsed footer for detached eval cells (2026-07-31)

- `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts`: `ManagedCell` and `EvalDetachedCellStatusEntry` gain
  `startedAtMs` (epoch ms at cell creation); the manager accepts an injectable `now`.
- `src/extension/eval-status.ts`: `formatEvalCellStatus(entries, nowMs)` appends the oldest
  cell's goal-style elapsed label (`↗ py · title (45s)`, `↗ eval 2: a, b (3m)`); the 48-char
  budget and `+N more` packing are preserved.
- `src/extension/eval-status-ticker.ts` (new): `EvalStatusTicker`, same shape as the terminal
  builtin's `MonitorStatusTicker` — 1s unref'd interval, label dedupe, stop-and-clear when the
  last detached cell settles. `src/index.ts` routes `showDetachedCells` through the ticker and
  stops it in `dropRuntime`; `SenpiCodemodeOptions` gains an optional `now` clock for tests.
- Tests: `test/eval-status.test.ts` (elapsed rendering + budget), `test/eval-status-ticker.test.ts`
  (new; interval discipline), `test/eval-status-wiring.test.ts` (footer advances 1s→2s→3s while
  a cell stays detached, clears on completion).


- `src/extension/eval-status.ts` (new): `formatEvalCellStatus(entries)` — undefined when
  no cell is detached, `↗ <lang> · <title>` for one (cellId fallback when untitled),
  `↗ eval N: <packed titles>` for many, 48-char budget with whole-label packing and a
  `+N more` tail. `EVAL_CELLS_STATUS_KEY = "eval-cells"`. Semantics mirror the terminal
  extension's monitor-status so both live watches read the same in the footer.
- `src/tool/detached-cell-manager.ts`: `EvalDetachedCellStatusEntry` plus the
  `onStatusChange` option. Emissions happen only inside `#transition` (the single
  detach/terminal boundary) and in `detach()`, so the listener always observes the
  exact live detached set; an empty array means "clear the status".
- `src/index.ts`: `showDetachedCells` publishes the formatted status through
  `ctx.ui.setStatus("eval-cells", ...)`, highlighted with `selectedBg` in tui mode and
  left plain elsewhere. Hosts that hand a partial ui surface (no theme) fall back to
  plain text instead of breaking the cell lifecycle.
- Tests: `test/eval-status.test.ts` (formatter), new `eval detached cell status
  emissions` block in `test/eval-detach.test.ts` (manager contract), and
  `test/eval-status-wiring.test.ts` (extension → footer wiring through session_start).
