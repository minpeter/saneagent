### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Recover a provider response that reports the `tool_use` stop reason while carrying no tool-call block. The turn is retried once on models that already use stream recovery, and the contradictory terminal state is demoted to a coherent stop for every model, so a lost tool call no longer ends the turn silently.

- Fixed proxied assistant responses dropping persisted provider-native thinking levels.
- Fixed the write tool reporting UTF-16 code-unit counts as byte counts by removing the misleading count ([#8979](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8979)).
- Fixed Windows `NodeExecutionEnv` aborts crashing when `taskkill.exe` is unavailable on `PATH` ([#6596](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6596)).

- Fixed queued steering and follow-up messages still reaching the provider after a queue clear on a terminating continuation: the terminating continuation boundary now runs before the drained queue is refreshed, so a clear or replacement at `turn_start` wins over pending input.
- Fixed `prepareNextTurn` and `prepareNextTurnWithContext` being skipped on completed turns without tool calls: the next-turn preparation now runs after every completed assistant turn that can reach the preparation boundary, including a normal stop response, while the terminating queue boundary and ownership refresh are preserved before a continuation provider request.
- Fixed next-turn compaction firing on completed turns that will not reach the provider: compaction is now gated on real provider admission (a tool continuation or queued message actually being admitted), while the next-turn callback keeps running on every completed turn and the late queue re-sample and one bounded callback replay after compaction are retained.

- The harness `convertToLlm` (`packages/agent/src/harness/messages.ts`) now drops assistant turns with `stopReason` `error` or `aborted`, and the tool results orphaned by that drop, from its output via the shared `dropFailedAssistantTurns` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, so compaction, branch summarization, and any consumer building an LLM request from the converted list never replay a failed provider turn's partial text or unexecuted tool calls. A call id re-declared by a kept assistant keeps its result.

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Harness tool contexts accept an optional `postMutate` hook. It runs inside the file mutation queue immediately after `write` or `edit` commits its bytes, so a formatter or normalizer can adjust the file as an atomic part of the same mutation. `edit` recomputes its diff and unified patch against the post-hook file contents whenever the hook may have touched the file, and a rejecting hook is reported as an appended warning note rather than discarding the landed write. Tool behavior is unchanged when no hook is supplied.

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Provider idle after completed Cursor tools (or buffered exec results) now ends the turn as `stop` instead of hanging until `StreamIdleTimeoutError` ([#999](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/999) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor often ends a turn as `stop` while the assistant message still contains toolCall blocks. Those turns now continue as `toolUse` so pending tools run instead of being dropped ([#1016](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1016) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor exec handler factories now receive the owning run's abort signal instead of the per-request
  idle-timeout controller, so native Cursor exec tool calls pass the run-ownership check again instead
  of failing every call with `Tool execution has no active run` ([#1002](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1002) by [@HeiTuz](https://github.com/HeiTuz)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.19] - 2026-08-19

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Aborting a run now releases a tool call that ignores its abort signal and never settles. Tool execution races the run's abort signal instead of awaiting the tool alone, so the run reaches `agent_end` and the session goes idle instead of hanging with an unresponsive ESC while the TUI shows `Running <tool>` ([#970](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/970)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.18-3] - 2026-08-18

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- `ThinkingSelection` provenance now travels from agent state through `createLoopConfig`, mid-run
  `prepareNextTurn` updates (undefined leaves unchanged, null clears), and the remote proxy's
  serializable options, letting providers distinguish an explicit user choice from the
  always-materialized effective reasoning level.

### Changed

- `AgentLoopConfig.cursorExecHandlers` additionally accepts a factory taking the owning run's abort signal, so
  a host bridge can bind each Cursor exec stream to the run that opened it. The plain-object form is unchanged.

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.8.18-2] - 2026-08-18

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Late Cursor exec-bridge lifecycle events that settle after an abort or timeout are tied to their originating run, so they neither raise an unhandled `Agent listener invoked outside active run` error nor leak into a replacement run ([#935](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/935)).

### Changed

## [2026.8.17] - 2026-08-17

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- The agent loop understands Cursor's server-driven tool execution: tool calls the `cursor-agent` provider already executed mid-stream (marked `kCursorExecResolved`) are never re-executed, their provider-buffered results are appended right after the assistant message (also on error/abort paths so calls never end up unpaired), and the stream idle watchdog re-arms while the provider reports pending local tool work instead of aborting a healthy request. `AgentOptions.cursorExecHandlers` carries the host's exec bridge onto the loop config, and `Agent.emitExternalEvent()` lets bridge-run tools surface `tool_execution_*` lifecycle events ([#910](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/910)).

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.8.16] - 2026-08-16

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Windows process-tree shutdown now resolves `taskkill.exe` through absolute `System32` and `Sysnative` paths before PATH lookup, executes synchronously so same-tick exits still terminate descendants, and falls back to the direct child only when no launcher can start ([#807](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/807) by [@yeongjunyoo](https://github.com/yeongjunyoo)).

## [2026.8.13] - 2026-08-13

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the legacy harness session model with the lane-based `Session`, `SessionStorage`, and `SessionRepo`
  APIs, including durable operation records, global facts, shared sequence numbers, and tree-scoped lane views.
- Promoted `AgentHarness` v2 and the new session API to the default export, removed the experimental subpaths,
  and removed the legacy JSONL and in-memory repository APIs.
- Required harness file-system implementations to provide atomic same-filesystem `renameFile()` semantics.

### Added

- Added typed AI-request and harness telemetry schemas, reusable callbacks, and a generated schema reference.
- Added bounded branch-entry queries, indexed open-operation recovery, a compile-complete `AgentHarness` v2
  scaffold, and the append-only v4 `JsonlSessionRepo`.
- Added `AgentOptions.shouldStopAfterTurn`, arbitrary OpenAI-compatible `samplingParams` proxy forwarding, and
  blocked-tool `terminate` handling for all-terminating batches.

### Changed

- Backfilled the durable `AgentHarness` design docs (`docs/harness.md`, `docs/harness-v2.md`) from upstream
  v0.83.0; upstream v0.82.1 and v0.83.0 shipped no other agent-package changes.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Agent.reset()` mutating transcript and runtime state during active runs; reset now rejects until idle.
- Fixed Windows path handling for execution-environment basenames, recursive skill loading, and prompt templates.
- Fixed JSONL session IDs being treated as globally unique across working directories.
- Fixed JSONL forks and torn-tail repairs publishing non-atomically after interrupted writes.

- Refresh `abortServerSideFallback` from the host's next-turn snapshot so an active agent run cannot carry a prior
  model's server-fallback policy into the next provider request
  ([#796](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/796)).
- The Node harness Windows process-tree kill no longer raises an uncaught `spawn taskkill ENOENT`. It tries every
  absolute `System32` / `Sysnative` `taskkill.exe` before the PATH-resolved name, runs synchronously so a teardown
  that exits in the same tick still terminates its children, and degrades to killing the direct child only when no
  launcher starts at all ([#812](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/812),
  [#807](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/807)).

- Retry one assistant `stop` response with no visible text or tool call for Claude, Kimi, and configured text-tool
  protocols instead of only Kimi. Unicode format-only output such as zero-width spaces stays buffered with the
  discarded attempt, and a second invisible response remains a bounded explicit error.

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `Session` into the sole opened-session aggregate and replaced `SessionStorage`, `SessionRepo`, and concrete per-session persistence classes with a non-owning `SessionRepository` and caller-owned, async-disposable `SessionStore` instances. Create stores with `createInMemorySessionStore()` or `createJsonlSessionStore()`, compose them with `createSessionRepository({ store, search: createScanningSessionSearch(store) })`, and dispose the store after draining harness and session work.
- `Session` instances are now created by `SessionRepository`; direct construction from an independently supplied store and snapshot was removed.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Retry one Kimi-family provider turn when it ends with `stop` but contains neither non-empty visible text nor a tool
  call. A successful retry is committed once with an `empty_assistant_response_recovery` diagnostic; a second empty
  result becomes a visible bounded error instead of silently ending the session or looping. Error, abort, refusal,
  length, and tool-call terminal states retain their prior behavior
  ([#523](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/523)).

### Added

- Added a separate `streamStartTimeoutMs` agent-loop guard for bounding time to the first provider event independently from the normal between-event idle timeout ([#451](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/451)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Preserve queued steering and follow-up messages across provider idle-timeout retries, apply a 30-second idle cap only to the retry continuation, restore the configured timeout afterward, and retain queued input when the retry terminates with an error or abort ([#458](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/458) by [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).
- Abort and classify provider requests that never emit a first event through the new stream-start timeout so dead upstreams fail into retry/fallback policy instead of freezing an agent run for the full idle budget ([#451](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/451)).

## [0.82.0] - 2026-07-24

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `AgentHarness`'s `ExecutionEnv` dependency and context-free `AgentTool` inputs with application-defined `toolContext` values and context-aware `AgentHarnessTool` definitions.

### Added

- Added context-aware `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash` harness tools backed by `ExecutionEnv`, including async bash execution preparation.

### Changed

- Aligned harness tool path handling, edit serialization, shell output capture, explicit non-inherited environments, and cross-platform process cleanup with coding-agent behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed compaction and branch-summary requests to use fresh routing session IDs with prompt caching disabled where supported ([#6618](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6618) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier)).

## [0.81.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added retry policy support and lifecycle events for compaction and branch-summary operations in `AgentHarness` ([#6901](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6901) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Fixed

- Restored the `Agent` `streamFn` option and host-configurable fallback for omitted agent-loop stream functions without reintroducing a `pi-ai/compat` dependency ([#6915](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6915)).

## [0.81.0] - 2026-07-21

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `SessionStorage` to use `getPathToRootOrCompaction()`, require session name and statistics methods, support cursor-based entry reads, and store retained compaction tails as self-contained checkpoints ([#6594](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6594) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Moved the `uuidv7` export to `@earendil-works/pi-ai` ([#6834](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6834) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Replaced the optional `Agent` `streamFn` fallback with a required `streamFunction` and made low-level loop stream functions required, preventing `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` and all built-in providers from entering selective-provider bundles ([#6851](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6851)).

### Added

- Added usage metadata to tool results, compaction entries, and branch summaries in the agent harness ([#6671](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6671) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

- Failed tool calls from length-truncated assistant messages.
- Normalized null message content at ingestion boundaries.

### Removed

## [2026.7.9] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added an exported `prepareAgentToolCall` helper so host integrations can reuse agent-loop tool argument preparation and schema validation.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed harness session storage short entry ids to use the random tail of the generated uuidv7 instead of the timestamp prefix, which was nearly constant between calls ([#6242](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6242)).
- Fixed the agent loop leaving the provider request dangling when the stream idle timeout fires: the loop now passes a per-request abort signal to the stream function and aborts it on idle timeout, so dead connections (e.g. after a network drop and reconnect) are torn down instead of leaking.

## [0.75.5] - 2026-05-23

## [0.75.4] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Removed the package-level development watch script now that the root TypeScript check validates strip-only-compatible sources.

### Fixed

- Fixed tool-call preflight to stop preparing sibling tool calls after the run is aborted ([#4276](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4276)).

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated public TypeBox-facing types and examples from `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x to `typebox` 1.x. Install and import from `typebox` instead of relying on `@sinclair/typebox` transitively ([#3112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3112))

### Added

- Added `terminate: true` tool-result hints to skip the automatic follow-up LLM call when every finalized tool result in the current batch opts into early termination ([#3525](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3525))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `streamProxy()` to preserve the proxy-safe serializable subset of stream options, including session, transport, retry-delay, metadata, header, cache-retention, and thinking-budget settings ([#3512](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3512))
- Fixed parallel tool execution to emit `tool_execution_end` as soon as each tool is finalized, while still emitting persisted tool-result messages in assistant source order ([#3503](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3503))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- Clarified parallel tool execution ordering docs to specify that final tool lifecycle and tool-result artifacts are emitted in tool completion order.

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Fixed parallel tool-call finalization to convert `afterToolCall` hook throws into error tool results instead of aborting the batch ([#3084](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3084))

### Breaking Changes

- `AgentState` has been reshaped:
  - `streamMessage` was renamed to `streamingMessage`
  - `error` was renamed to `errorMessage`
  - `isStreaming`, `streamingMessage`, `pendingToolCalls`, and `errorMessage` are now readonly in the public API
  - `pendingToolCalls` is now typed as `ReadonlySet<string>`
  - `tools` and `messages` are now accessor properties, and assigning either field copies the provided top-level array instead of preserving array identity
- `AgentOptions.initialState` no longer accepts runtime-owned fields. Remove `isStreaming`, `streamingMessage`, `pendingToolCalls`, and `errorMessage` from `initialState` values.
- Removed `Agent` mutator methods in favor of direct property access:
  - `agent.setSystemPrompt(value)` -> `agent.state.systemPrompt = value`
  - `agent.setModel(model)` -> `agent.state.model = model`
  - `agent.setThinkingLevel(level)` -> `agent.state.thinkingLevel = level`
  - `agent.setTools(tools)` -> `agent.state.tools = tools`
  - `agent.replaceMessages(messages)` -> `agent.state.messages = messages`
  - `agent.appendMessage(message)` -> `agent.state.messages.push(message)`
  - `agent.clearMessages()` -> `agent.state.messages = []`
  - `agent.setToolExecution(mode)` -> `agent.toolExecution = mode`
  - `agent.setBeforeToolCall(fn)` -> `agent.beforeToolCall = fn`
  - `agent.setAfterToolCall(fn)` -> `agent.afterToolCall = fn`
  - `agent.setTransport(transport)` -> `agent.transport = transport`
- Removed queue mode getter/setter methods in favor of properties:
  - `agent.setSteeringMode(mode)` -> `agent.steeringMode = mode`
  - `agent.getSteeringMode()` -> `agent.steeringMode`
  - `agent.setFollowUpMode(mode)` -> `agent.followUpMode = mode`
  - `agent.getFollowUpMode()` -> `agent.followUpMode`
- `Agent.subscribe()` listeners are now awaited and receive the active `AbortSignal`:
  - `agent.subscribe((event) => { ... })` -> `agent.subscribe(async (event, signal) => { ... })`
  - `agent_end` is now the final emitted event for a run, but not the idle boundary
  - `agent.waitForIdle()`, `agent.prompt(...)`, and `agent.continue()` now settle only after awaited `agent_end` listeners finish
  - `agent.state.isStreaming` remains `true` until that settlement completes

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `AgentTool.prepareArguments` hook to prepare raw tool call arguments before schema validation, enabling compatibility shims for resumed sessions with outdated tool schemas

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `Agent.signal` to expose the active abort signal for the current turn, allowing callers to forward cancellation into nested async work ([#2660](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2660))

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `beforeToolCall` and `afterToolCall` hooks to `AgentOptions` and `AgentLoopConfig` for preflight blocking and post-execution tool result mutation.

### Changed

- Added configurable tool execution mode to `Agent` and `agentLoop` via `toolExecution: "parallel" | "sequential"`, with `parallel` as the default. Parallel mode preflights tool calls sequentially, executes allowed tools concurrently, and emits final tool results in assistant source order.

### Breaking Changes

- **Queue API replaced with steer/followUp**: The `queueMessage()` method has been split into two methods with different delivery semantics ([#403](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/403)):
  - `steer(msg)`: Interrupts the agent mid-run. Delivered after current tool execution, skips remaining tools.
  - `followUp(msg)`: Waits until the agent finishes. Delivered only when there are no more tool calls or steering messages.
- **Queue mode renamed**: `queueMode` option renamed to `steeringMode`. Added new `followUpMode` option. Both control whether messages are delivered one-at-a-time or all at once.
- **AgentLoopConfig callbacks renamed**: `getQueuedMessages` split into `getSteeringMessages` and `getFollowUpMessages`.
- **Agent methods renamed**:
  - `queueMessage()` → `steer()` and `followUp()`
  - `clearMessageQueue()` → `clearSteeringQueue()`, `clearFollowUpQueue()`, `clearAllQueues()`
  - `setQueueMode()`/`getQueueMode()` → `setSteeringMode()`/`getSteeringMode()` and `setFollowUpMode()`/`getFollowUpMode()`

### Fixed

- `prompt()` and `continue()` now throw if called while the agent is already streaming, preventing race conditions and corrupted state. Use `steer()` or `followUp()` to queue messages during streaming, or `await` the previous call.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Transport abstraction removed**: `ProviderTransport`, `AppTransport`, and `AgentTransport` interface have been removed. Use the `streamFn` option directly for custom streaming implementations.

- **Agent options renamed**:
  - `transport` → removed (use `streamFn` instead)
  - `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
  - `preprocessor` → `transformContext`

- **`AppMessage` renamed to `AgentMessage`**: All references to `AppMessage` have been renamed to `AgentMessage` for consistency.

- **`CustomMessages` renamed to `CustomAgentMessages`**: The declaration merging interface has been renamed.

- **`UserMessageWithAttachments` and `Attachment` types removed**: Attachment handling is now the responsibility of the `convertToLlm` function.

- **Agent loop moved from `@mariozechner/pi-ai`**: The `agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, and related types have moved to this package. Import from `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core` instead.

### Added

- `streamFn` option on `Agent` for custom stream implementations. Default uses `streamSimple` from pi-ai.

- `streamProxy()` utility function for browser apps that need to proxy LLM calls through a backend server. Replaces the removed `AppTransport`.

- `getApiKey` option for dynamic API key resolution (useful for expiring OAuth tokens like GitHub Copilot).

- `agentLoop()` and `agentLoopContinue()` low-level functions for running the agent loop without the `Agent` class wrapper.

- New exported types: `AgentLoopConfig`, `AgentContext`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, `AgentToolUpdateCallback`, `StreamFn`.

### Changed

- `Agent` constructor now has all options optional (empty options use defaults).

- `queueMessage()` is now synchronous (no longer returns a Promise).
