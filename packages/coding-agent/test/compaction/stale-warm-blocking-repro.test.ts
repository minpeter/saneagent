/**
 * Reproduction for the Discord-reported "Compaction did not apply" loop:
 * an idle/speculative warm summary pins `expectedRevision` at snapshot time
 * (speculative.ts createSpeculativeCompactionSnapshot). Any revision bump
 * while idle — e.g. an extension appending a hidden custom message via
 * `ctx.sendMessage` (agent-session.ts sendCustomMessage immediate-append
 * branch increments `_messageRevision`) — makes the warm result stale.
 *
 * `applyBlockingCompaction` (builtin/compaction/index.ts) then treats the
 * stale warm result as TERMINAL: it ends feedback (which the session surfaces
 * as "Compaction did not apply") and returns WITHOUT regenerating a fresh
 * summary, even though the whole point of the blocking route is that the
 * session is over the compaction threshold right now. "rejected" and
 * "unavailable" results fall through to fresh core-route generation; "stale"
 * does not. Context then keeps growing and the same failure repeats on every
 * later trigger, matching the field logs (warm_consumed -> speculative_stale
 * with no apply, tokens climbing).
