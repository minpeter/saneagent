# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Oversized tool results are now capped before they enter the context. A single result is limited to
  `min(50000, max(8192, 5% of the context window))` with a deterministic, diskless head/tail
  projection. Admission is re-derived from content on every request, so output that reproduces the
  visible projection marker cannot bypass the cap. Disable with `compaction.toolAdmissionEnabled: false`.
- A context-budget reminder is delivered once per compaction generation as the remaining runway
  approaches the threshold, so the model can wrap up verbose exploration before the summary is
  taken. Disable with `compaction.reminderEnabled: false`.
- A grace band defers blocking compaction while a speculative summary is still generating, up to
  `min(threshold + lead, window - reserve)`. Past that cap it blocks as before. Disable with
  `compaction.graceBandEnabled: false`.

### Changed

- Speculative summarization now starts on an absolute lead of `clamp(threshold * 0.125, 8192, 32768)`
  tokens instead of a multiplicative fraction of the threshold, so a warm summary is generated close
  enough to the threshold to still be valid when it is needed. Idle warm generation may also begin at
  50% fill; the idle apply gates are unchanged. Override the lead with
  `compaction.speculativeLeadTokens` (clamped to the same range).
- The compaction threshold table gains large-window tiers: 0.70 above 128K and 0.80 above 512K, with
  the clamp widened to `[0.40, 0.85]`. Low-yield feedback can no longer raise a ratio above its tier
  base.
- The hard-limit reserve now scales with the context window as
  `max(configured, min(4% of window, 49152))`, moving the emergency valve off 98.4% on million-token
  windows. Disable with `compaction.reserveScalingEnabled: false`.
- While the compaction circuit breaker is cooling down and the context is over the threshold, the
  deterministic no-LLM context reduction now runs immediately instead of waiting out the cooldown.
- `grep` is temporarily withheld from the model-facing tool surface. It no longer appears in the
  system prompt or the active tool names, so the model can neither see nor call it. The tool is
  still built and stays resolvable by name for programmatic callers such as the Cursor exec bridge,
  and restoring it is removing its entry from `temporarilyDisabledToolNames`.

## [2026.8.28-2] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Terminal monitor snapshots now also publish on the RPC `extension_event` path as `terminal_monitor_state` (`activeCount` plus per-watch `id`/`description`/`paused`/`startedAtMs`). Clients receive them only when they advertise `extension_events`; the in-process `pi.events` channel is unchanged.

- `--auto-title-sessions` opts non-interactive launches into engine-side session auto-titling, so `--mode rpc` hosts (including `--multi-session`) generate session titles and publish them through the existing `session_info_changed` event. Resumed sessions that already have context messages are still never retitled.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Interactive crashes caused by a full filesystem (`ENOSPC`) or exhausted disk quota (`EDQUOT`) now explain what failed and tell the user to free filesystem space or quota before retrying, while preserving the original error and exit behavior ([#1184](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1184) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).

- A client socket that drops while its session's turn is still streaming no longer aborts the run mid-turn: the dropped connection's refcounted release is deferred until the turn settles (`agent_settled`/`agent_idle`), then the path reservation frees as before. This also fixes the RPC socket host never idle-exiting after such a drop (the sealed session leaked the lifecycle observer's busy counter, so the supervisor saw a permanently active turn).

- A model with no fallback chain of its own no longer wedges the session on a terminal error. `resolveChainKey` now falls through exact -> base -> a shipped `"*"` wildcard lane, so an upstream that hard-fails (e.g. repeated provider 500s) can still rotate to a healthy model instead of ending the turn permanently. The wildcard is a last resort only: a model's own chain wins, an in-flight fallback episode keeps walking its own chain, and an explicit `[]` tombstone on the model's key still switches fallback off (`hasExplicitFallbackOptOut`). Disable the lane itself with `"*": []`.

### Removed

## [2026.8.28] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Bun-compiled binaries now embed the imagegen bundled skill so resource discovery remains available after compilation.

- `/account <provider> [list | pin <name> | unpin | remove <name>]` manages any provider's credential accounts, the TUI footer shows the active account as `(provider@account)` whenever a provider pools more than one credential, `auth check --json` reports a non-secret `accounts` array, and the account RPC/app-server surfaces (`get_provider_accounts`, `account_pin`, `account_remove`, `account/providerAccounts/*`) now work for every provider instead of only the Claude lane.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Shared interactive host sessions no longer print `Thinking level: [object Promise]` on Shift+Tab: the TUI awaits the four session reads the shared-host proxy answers over RPC (`cycleThinkingLevel`, `getAvailableThinkingLevels`, `getSessionStats`, `getUserMessagesForForking`), the thinking-level status and footer render from the `thinking_level_changed` event so every attached client converges, and `/settings` thinking options, `/fork`, and `/session` work again.
- User messages no longer render twice in shared-host sessions: the RPC prompt success response now carries `data.disposition` (`started`/`queued`/`handled`), delivered through client response hooks that run synchronously inside frame dispatch, so optimistic user echoes resolve exactly like the local path; `streamingBehavior` and `thinkingLevel` are forwarded again, so mid-stream submissions queue instead of failing.
- Resuming a session that a live shared host already holds no longer fails with `session_path_in_use`: `open_session` on a fully-open path now attaches to the existing session (same handle, `attached: true`), and the runtime is torn down only when the last attachment closes.
- Fire-and-forget session setters proxied to the shared host (thinking level, steering/follow-up mode, auto-compaction, session name, bash abort) now surface RPC failures through a typed warning instead of vanishing silently.

- Imagegen missing-skill diagnostics now go to stderr, keeping RPC NDJSON stdout clean when a compiled binary lacks the optional skill asset.

### Removed

## [2026.8.27] - 2026-08-27

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Any provider holding more than one credential now rotates between them inside a single request: a conversation sticks to one account through session-stable HRW affinity, a 429 or 401 on one account fails over to a healthy sibling before the model fallback chain is consulted, and cooldowns persist across restarts with absolute deadlines. Rotation is transparent only before committed output - a failure after streaming has begun is never replayed. Providers with a single credential are unaffected.
- A second credential can be added with one environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY_2` and up, for any provider's primary key variable) or declared per provider in `models.json` under a validated `credentials` policy block (`rotation`, `affinity`, cooldown bounds, and named slot references). The block holds policy and references only; key material stays in `auth.json` or the environment.

### Fixed

- Goal tool results (`create_goal`, `update_goal`, `get_goal`) now render as a TUI widget — status-colored header with compact token and elapsed usage, objective preview (full objective plus created/updated timestamps when expanded), and the blocked reason — instead of dumping the raw JSON payload into the transcript. The model-facing JSON result text is unchanged.

- The interactive fast-mode indicator and RPC fast-mode state now clear when a session switches from a Codex model to a non-Codex model, instead of retaining a stale `⚡` marker from the previous provider.
- Native todo lists with an explicit empty `todos: []` payload now clear persisted todo state and remove the `todo-sidebar`, while absent payloads remain ignored and lists with pending work remain visible.
- Bash output spill files now capture early `EDQUOT`/`ENOSPC` stream errors and late filesystem
  close failures, waiting for the stream's terminal `close` event and failing only the tool call
  instead of returning an incomplete path or terminating the interactive session through
  `uncaughtException`.
- Tool results without a custom renderer (MCP-wrapped tools and third-party extensions in particular) that return a JSON payload now render as a bounded key-value view in the TUI instead of a raw JSON dump; prose and malformed-JSON outputs keep the previous rendering byte for byte.
- JavaScript-first `eval` guidance now makes the fastest composition path explicit: the first cells use the persistent JavaScript kernel, independent lookups fan out with `Promise.all`, and a later cell can continue in an idle Python kernel when JavaScript is occupied by detached work. This documents the runtime's actual multi-kernel execution model instead of teaching a serial Python-only workflow.
- JavaScript kernel persistence transforms now rewrite only top-level declarations and remain literal-safe, so strings and nested function bodies are not accidentally modified when state is carried from one cell to the next.
- Detached-eval busy diagnostics now identify the occupied cell and list each idle enabled kernel that can continue the step, turning a same-language contention failure into an actionable runtime choice.
- Eval orchestration keeps detached cells observable and bounded: completion, failure, cancellation, `peek`, and `stop` remain explicit lifecycle states; completion metadata records wall time, kernel time, detach state, and nested tool counts; and the hard wall-clock limit remains active across bridge calls and detachment.
- JavaScript eval remains available on supported Node runtimes while optional Python, Ruby, and Julia interpreters are capability-gated. The JavaScript kernel uses a persistent worker with a controlled inline fallback, and the runtime exposes bounded `parallel()`/`pipeline()` composition without claiming an unmeasured percentage speedup.

### Added

- Interactive sessions now use the shared multi-session Unix-socket RPC host by default when a persisted session is available, with attach-compatible protocol and capability handshakes; `SENPI_DISABLE_SHARED_HOST=1` opts a launch back into the local runtime. The host lifecycle supervisor provides transient/persistent idle-exit policy and an orphan-proof watchdog, and bundled clients can invoke the hidden supervisor route for the same behavior.
- Active goals now stop auto-continuing after 150 automatic continuations without accepted direct user input ([#1139](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1139)): a persisted unattended budget survives assistant-text changes and tool use, the goal blocks mechanically (`unattended continuation limit reached`), and any user message resumes it with the budget restored. Monitor-delayed deliveries (armed wake sources) do not consume the budget.

- `/account <provider> [list | pin <name> | unpin | remove <name>]` manages any provider's credential accounts, the TUI footer shows the active account as `(provider@account)` whenever a provider pools more than one credential, `auth check --json` reports a non-secret `accounts` array, and the account RPC/app-server surfaces (`get_provider_accounts`, `account_pin`, `account_remove`, `account/providerAccounts/*`) now work for every provider instead of only the Claude lane.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Shared-host `/resume` now completes for sessions with blocked or paused Goals and refreshes the interactive proxy's
  session identity, manager, history, and token context instead of timing out or returning to the empty bootstrap
  composer with a stale `0/1M` footer.
- Shared interactive host sessions no longer print `Thinking level: [object Promise]` on Shift+Tab: the TUI awaits the four session reads the shared-host proxy answers over RPC (`cycleThinkingLevel`, `getAvailableThinkingLevels`, `getSessionStats`, `getUserMessagesForForking`), the thinking-level status and footer render from the `thinking_level_changed` event so every attached client converges, and `/settings` thinking options, `/fork`, and `/session` work again.

The model-facing JSON result text is unchanged.

## [2026.8.26-2] - 2026-08-26

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Cursor quota and eligible hard-error fallback now advances after required pre-retry compaction is rejected instead of stalling the turn; ordinary transient retry compaction blocking is unchanged.
- Hard-error fallback exhaustion now emits `retry_fallback_exhausted` when the configured chain has no usable candidate.
- A goal continuation whose backstop timer fired after the session was replaced or reloaded no longer crashes the session with "This extension ctx is stale after session replacement or reload". The timer callback (and its own error handler) now treats a retired context as "no UI" instead of letting the stale-context error escape as an uncaught exception; unrelated delivery failures are still reported.
- Idle warm compaction now applies as soon as its summary finishes generating while the session is idle, so the `[compaction]` block renders during the idle gap and the next message stacks below it instead of the prompt waiting behind a compaction that was generated minutes earlier; stale or racy applies keep the previous warm-hold behavior.
- The canonical user message no longer renders above the `[compaction]` block when a compaction applies during prompt admission: the pending-echo reconciliation now appends it after the rebuilt transcript, matching the session's canonical order.
- An uncaught dead-terminal error (e.g. a stdin read EIO after the controlling terminal detached) no longer prints the `exiting due to uncaughtException` banner and exits 1: `uncaughtCrash` routes it to the silent `emergencyTerminalExit()`, matching terminal write errors. `isDeadTerminalError` now also accepts Bun's raw `errno: 5`/`-5` shape.
- config-reload no longer rejects a directory watch target that covers the agent directory when every filter glob is root-anchored and none of the anchored paths intersects a protected path (`auth.json`, `sessions/`, `logs/`) in either direction. With the default `~/.omo/agent` layout this lets the omo extension's `~/.omo` user-config watch register instead of failing with "Configuration watch target is restricted" (code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#7064). Unfiltered targets, unanchored filters, and filters resolving into or onto a protected path stay rejected.
- A crash that kills the interactive session is now recorded in the debug log (`<agent dir>/<brand>-debug.log`) as an `uncaught crash (<origin>)` entry with the error and stack, redacted and written with `0600` permissions. Previously the crash banner reached only the terminal, so closing the terminal — or a crash caused by the terminal itself — left no evidence to diagnose. The crash path itself is unchanged: same ordering, same exit code, same banner, and a failed log write cannot affect it.
### Added

### Changed

### Removed

## [2026.8.26] - 2026-08-26

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- A manual `/compact` that has nothing left to summarize is now rejected before it aborts the active post-compaction continuation, so an in-flight turn survives instead of terminally ending with "Nothing to compact".
- Long-lived sessions no longer stop compacting after ten successful compactions: the absolute session cap became telemetry only, while the failure circuit breaker still halts repeated failed or ineffective attempts.
- Compaction todo snapshots now capture only the latest todo phases from the active branch instead of recursively retaining the full `senpi.todo-state` history, which grew to megabytes and refilled the context right after a compaction; legacy raw-entry snapshots are normalized before restore.
- Installing the CLI no longer warns `incorrect peer dependency "@anthropic-ai/sdk@0.91.1"`: the pinned `@anthropic-ai/sdk` now satisfies `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `>=0.93.0` peer range.

### Added

### Removed

## [2026.8.25] - 2026-08-25

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the inherited `GoogleThinkingLevel` type to `GoogleApiThinkingLevel` and added `ResolvedGoogleThinkingLevel` for normalized adapter levels.
### Fixed

- Cursor token-bearing `resource_exhausted` failures now fall back to the next provider model without incorrectly triggering compaction, and terminal quota failures explain the likely usage-pool cause.
- Logging in while a provider already holds more than one credential no longer replaces every stored credential with the new one. `AuthStorage` writes (including the RPC `login_api_key` path), `Models.login`, and OAuth token refresh now preserve sibling slots and the pinned slot; a flat single-credential entry keeps its exact previous shape until a second credential actually exists.
- Provider stream stalls can no longer be turned into terminal watchdog aborts after the first retry: the configured retry budget is now spent, the final error preserves the real watchdog/provider cause, and unhinted transient retry delays include bounded jitter while provider hints and 429 floors remain intact.
- Loop-guard blocks for terminal/task polling now direct the agent to stop
  repeating the target and use a monitor, supported completion notification, or
  re-plan instead of changing arguments to evade escalation.
- The interactive TUI resume hint now uses the brand executable name (`APP_COMMAND`) instead of the display name, so a brand whose binary is `omo` no longer prints `OmO --session <id>`.
- TTSR now watches streamed tool-call arguments and interrupts collapse floods inside tool inputs, preventing corrupted argument generations from reaching persisted session history.
- Fixed failed extension factories leaving event subscriptions, provider registrations, and default flag state active ([#8424](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8424) by [@acmerfight](https://github.com/acmerfight)).

- Fixed `/model` and `/thinking` selections being persisted globally unless explicitly saved with Ctrl+S ([#5263](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5263)).
- Fixed JSON and RPC `toolcall_start` events omitting the tool call id and name ([#7953](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7953) by [@christianklotz](https://github.com/christianklotz)).

- Fixed compaction and branch summarization requests exposing tools to providers.
- Fixed single-object `edit` tool inputs failing validation by accepting them as one-edit arrays in both coding-agent and harness edit tools ([#7835](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7835)).
- Fixed root Markdown files such as `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` in skill directories being reported as broken skills unless they declare valid skill frontmatter ([#7805](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7805)).
- Fixed the default Cerebras model referencing an unavailable Z.AI model.
- Fixed inherited OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions reasoning replay to preserve and resend assistant-level `reasoning_details` verbatim and in order ([#7994](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7994)).
- Fixed inherited Anthropic server-side fallback responses being priced with the requested model instead of the returned fallback model ([#8285](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8285)).

- Fixed inherited Amazon Bedrock dropping and failing to replay opaque redacted reasoning from non-Anthropic models ([#8314](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8314) by [@seiji](https://github.com/seiji)).
- Fixed inherited Z.AI Coding Plan models deriving incomplete reasoning-effort metadata, including missing GLM-5.3 low, high, and max levels ([#8336](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8336)).
- Fixed inherited DeepSeek V4 Flash on OpenCode and OpenCode Go omitting its supported low thinking level ([#8181](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8181) by [@tianshuang](https://github.com/tianshuang)).
- Fixed inherited Azure OpenAI Responses ignoring `toolChoice` in provider-specific stream requests.
- Fixed inherited Amazon Bedrock response hooks receiving only a synthesized request id instead of the raw response headers ([#8234](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8234)).
- Fixed inherited Kimi usage reporting so top-level `cached_tokens` count as cache reads instead of normal input tokens ([#8075](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8075)).
- Fixed inherited Google custom models ignoring `thinkingLevelMap`, which dropped extended thinking controls ([#8135](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8135)).
- Fixed writes to `auth.json` and `models-store.json` overriding administrator-managed file permissions and ACLs ([#7779](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7779)).

- Fixed the subagent example repeatedly prompting before running project-local agents in trusted repositories ([#8261](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8261)).
- Added `session_compact_failed` extension events so compaction failures and aborts expose their reason, retry state, source, and error message to handlers ([#8175](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8175)).
- Fixed truncated compaction and branch summaries being persisted when generation reaches its output token limit ([#7048](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7048)).
- Fixed npm package update checks treating older registry versions as available updates, preventing `pi update` from downgrading already-newer installed packages ([#8226](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8226)).
- Fixed built-in llama.cpp models disappearing from `/model` when `/llama` refreshed a configured server under `PI_OFFLINE`, and included idle-slept `sleeping` router models plus autoloadable unloaded presets in the selectable catalog ([#8167](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8167)).
- Fixed `pi.registerFlag()` accepting default values that do not match the declared flag type ([#8064](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8064)).

- Fixed llama.cpp login guidance to direct users to `/llama` before `/model` when no local models are loaded ([#8203](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8203)).
- Fixed hung pi.dev model catalog requests consuming the entire refresh deadline without retrying ([#8198](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8198)).
- Fixed inherited Xiaomi model catalogs listing shut-down MiMo V2 models in `/model` and `--list-models` ([#8187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8187)).
- Fixed branch summary entries recording the navigation destination in `fromId` instead of the pre-navigation source leaf.
- Fixed threshold auto-compaction being skipped when providers omit streaming usage data ([#8328](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8328)).
- Fixed dash-prefixed prompts being parsed as options by supporting `--` as an end-of-options delimiter ([#7269](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7269)).
- Fixed built-in llama.cpp models remaining selectable when autoload is enabled, including sleeping router models and unloaded presets.
### Added

- Exposed RPC queue clearing through the public command and client APIs.

- **PowerShell tool** — Use optional native PowerShell command execution on Windows. See [PowerShell Tool](docs/windows.md#powershell-tool).
- **Safer managed updates** — Stage, verify, and atomically activate updates for installer-managed installations. See [Install and Manage](docs/packages.md#install-and-manage).
- **Model and thinking controls** — Select thinking levels with `/thinking`, search defaults, keep selections session-scoped, and persist them explicitly with Ctrl+S. See [Models and Thinking](docs/keybindings.md#models-and-thinking).
### Changed

- RPC child startup now lazy-loads the interactive TUI mode graph at mode dispatch, avoiding parsing interactive-only components for headless sessions while preserving the interactive path.
- Changed experimental installer-managed installations so `pi update` stages, verifies, and atomically activates the selected release in place. See [Install and Manage](docs/packages.md#install-and-manage).
- Changed inherited built-in xAI models to use the Responses API with encrypted reasoning replay and made Grok 4.6 the default xAI model ([#8124](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8124) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).
- Changed inherited Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google, Mistral, and OpenAI adapters to send Pi's default `User-Agent` unless overridden ([#8305](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8305)).
- Changed Windows and WSL keybinding defaults to avoid terminal-reserved shortcuts for image paste, model cycling, editor undo, fullscreen transcript navigation and search, and message queueing ([#8372](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8372)).
- Changed Bun release archives to ship the native clipboard binary only inside the wrapper package, removing a duplicate platform package from each archive.
- Changed package resource glob expansion to use Node.js's built-in implementation with deterministic visible-path matching, reducing the installed runtime dependency tree.
- Changed the bundled Node.js runtime to load jiti only when importing an extension and Babel only when uncached source needs transformation, reducing CLI startup time and bundle size.
- Changed syntax highlighting to initialize only twenty common languages eagerly and defer the remaining grammars until after the initial TUI render, reducing CLI startup time.
- Changed the Node.js CLI and RPC entrypoints to load a bundled runtime, reducing startup filesystem reads while keeping the public library and legacy module paths on the modular runtime for normal dependency identity.
### Removed

## [2026.8.24] - 2026-08-24

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Terminal provider failures and retry-watchdog cancellations no longer masquerade as user aborts or mechanically block an active Goal: the TUI now renders provider, system, and explicit user cancellation with distinct persisted labels, while exhausted provider retries stage one guarded post-settlement Goal recovery and explicit user aborts remain stopped.
- The read tool now rejects `local://` URIs with actionable guidance instead of resolving them as relative paths and failing with a confusing `ENOENT <cwd>/local:/...`; the error names the eval kernel `read()` helper and the plain-absolute-path alternative, so agents following detached-eval spill notices recover in one step ([#1103](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1103)).
- Assistant text painted during smooth streaming no longer vanishes and bursts back: `syncTrailingAssistantText` now yields the streaming head to the reveal controller while it paces (smooth streaming on, no toolCall in the head), so the paced prefix and the full head can no longer overwrite each other mid-stream ([#1102](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1102)).
- The goal continuation wait countdown no longer renders over the Working indicator during externally started turns; the `goal-wait` footer segment now hides while a turn runs and restores itself when the session parks again, leaving the cache-warm schedule and iteration accounting untouched ([#1100](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1100)).
- Webfetch now safely discards redirect response bodies under Bun 1.4.0's bare `undici`, which may omit `body.dump()`, by falling back to argument-free stream destruction instead of re-emitting cleanup failures as uncaught stream errors ([#1089](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1089)).

## [2026.8.23] - 2026-08-23

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- User `models.json` files may now declare the `video` input modality for custom provider models, matching the runtime model type and the builtin Kimi Coding catalog; previously a video entry failed schema validation, which rejected the entire models.json and unregistered every user-defined provider ([#1087](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1087)).

- Providers can now declare their own retry policy profile, and the new `retry.providers.<id>` settings map tunes per-provider scheduling knobs (`maxRetries`, `baseDelayMs`) with warn-only validation that rejects an invalid entry atomically. Kimi For Coding adopts kimi-code's own policy: 10 total same-model attempts with 500ms-base exponential backoff (32s per-attempt cap, +0..25% jitter), server-requested waits honored without a ceiling, and rate limits spending the full same-model budget before model fallback. Providers without a declared profile keep their existing behavior, and `retry.enabled: false` remains a hard gate over everything ([#1121](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1121)).

### Changed

- Locally computed retry backoff for the default profile is now capped at 8 seconds per attempt and carries +0..25% additive jitter to avoid synchronized retry bursts; explicit server-requested waits and hint-tier schedules stay exact ([#1121](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1121)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.22-2] - 2026-08-22

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Fixed a session-liveness wait that could pin a CPU core at 100% by resampling settled promises in a tight microtask loop; it now yields a real event-loop turn when a queued work item does not converge, restoring RPC responsiveness under load ([#1084](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1084)).
- The interactive TUI now keeps the working dock painted across adjacent and locally buffered turns, and clears it on the new core `agent_idle` event - emitted only after settlement-deferred turns (TTSR, loop-guard, goal recovery) resolve without starting a run - so the editor/footer no longer bounce at queued-turn boundaries. A buffered prompt consumed with `action: "handled"` (for example a `UserPromptSubmit` hook block) also clears the retained dock, prompt admission failure clears it, and clear-on-shrink reserves the dock's measured height, together eliminating the vertical jitter.

- Goal cache-warm notices now render the expected wake time in the user's local system timezone with a short zone label (for example `ready 2026-08-22 16:51 GMT+9 (4m 30s)`), falling back to the legacy UTC shape when local timezone formatting is unavailable ([#1074](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1074)).

### Added

- A CLI installed with `bun install -g` now runs on the Bun runtime automatically: the entry point detects that its own script lives in Bun's global install tree and re-execs itself through the installed `bun` binary instead of staying on the Node runtime its shebang picked. Set `SENPI_RUNTIME=node` to force Node or `SENPI_RUNTIME=bun` to request Bun for any install; debugger sessions (`--inspect`) and runs that are already on Bun keep their current runtime, and a missing `bun` binary silently keeps the CLI on Node.

### Changed

- Automatic startup selection for the built-in OpenAI and Codex providers now defaults to GPT-5.6 Sol instead of GPT-5.5. Explicitly saved GPT-5.5 selections remain supported.

### Removed

## [2026.8.22] - 2026-08-22

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- The `permission-system` builtin extension now handles rejection during `session_shutdown` without causing an unhandled promise rejection / `uncaughtException` when permission prompts are pending.

### Added

### Removed

## [2026.8.21-3] - 2026-08-21

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Agentic turns no longer shake the transcript up and down: assistant text painted between tool cards keeps its position instead of teleporting above the cards whenever the next tool call arrives. The streaming message component now owns only the content through the first tool call, and each text segment after it renders in a persistent component at its chronological position (#1064).

- Prompts submitted while the agent is streaming (steer/follow-up) render as the queued waiting state (`Steering:`/`Follow-up:` pending display) again instead of appearing as already-sent user messages; the optimistic submit echo now applies only to prompts that actually start immediately. Messages queued during compaction likewise no longer paint a sent-looking bubble.

### Removed

## [2026.8.21-2] - 2026-08-21

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Contended auth-storage lock retries now sleep via `Atomics.wait` instead of busy-waiting, matching the settings-lock fix (#1056). The auth store kept the original spin loop, so under multi-session OAuth-refresh contention a synchronous auth write could burn a CPU core on the main thread.
- Selecting a model now releases the selector and repaints immediately instead of after the provider auth check resolves. The overlay is disposed on Enter, so waiting for that round trip (a network call for subscription-OAuth providers such as Cursor) left the TUI showing a frozen frame on the previous model.
- Cursor agent turns now finish promptly when `turnEnded` arrives even if the server leaves HTTP/2 open, while silent pre-completion streams fail after a heartbeat-aware health bound instead of freezing until the generic five-minute idle timeout.

### Added

### Removed

## [2026.8.21] - 2026-08-21

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Interactive submissions now render a local pending user echo immediately, reconcile it with the canonical `message_start`, and remove it for rejected or extension-handled input without writing render-only state to session history.
- The `claude-sdk-oauth` lane now surfaces Claude policy refusals (for example cybersecurity refusals) as an immediate, user-visible error naming the refusal category and explanation, instead of hanging until the ~90s stream watchdog timeout. Refusals are classified as non-retryable, so they no longer enter the timeout-retry ladder or account failover ([#1052](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1052)).
- Contended settings-lock retries now sleep via `Atomics.wait` instead of busy-waiting, retry-fallback canonicalization is memoized per error burst, and `cursor-cli-oauth`/`claude-sdk-oauth` settings loads are cached by mtime+size. Together these eliminate the settings-lock CPU-spin that froze the TUI at ~100% CPU under provider-error storms ([#1056](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1056)).

### Added

### Changed

- Settings reads no longer acquire the settings lock: writes publish atomically via a same-directory temp file plus rename, so read-only settings loads skip lock acquisition entirely and can never observe a torn write. Concurrent writers still serialize on the lock and re-merge against the winner's content.

- Refreshed dependency pins, including `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.3.238, `jsdom` 30, `undici` 8.10.0, `marked` 18.0.10, `highlight.js` 11.12.0, `grok-mermaid` 0.2.3, `minimatch` 10.2.6, `ws` 8.21.3, and `typebox` 1.3.16, and removed the unused `@mistralai/mistralai` and `@types/ms` entries.

- The `monitor` tool's description, schema text, prompt guidance, and terminal docs now state the verified contract (PTY output with stderr merged, event-only filtering, dedup and pause semantics) and include worked recipes plus an anti-pattern reference.

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.8.20-2] - 2026-08-20

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Webfetch's Bun-compatible response cleanup now drains bodies without `dump()` before destruction and guards discard-time stream errors from escaping as uncaught process errors, adapting the lifecycle hardening proposed by `@Indosaram` in [`pi-webfetch` #7](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/pi-webfetch/pull/7).

### Added

### Changed

- The compiled `senpi` binary is now built with Bun 1.4.0 stable (previously 1.3.14), and npm publishing runs on Bun 1.4 stable instead of the canary channel. Dependency pins refreshed: Biome 2.5.9, `@types/node` 26.2.0, `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.11, AWS Bedrock/Smithy client patches, `@bufbuild/protobuf` 2.14.0, `@types/semver` 7.8.0.

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.8.20] - 2026-08-20

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- `/resume` now reuses exact, byte-bounded streaming session summaries for unchanged files and paints the visible transcript tail before progressively warming older messages, avoiding repeat parse/render stalls without weakening picker metadata or full-text search.
- Assistant text that arrives after the last tool call now renders below the tool cards instead of updating the blob above the stack, so approval questions stay visible ([#993](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/993) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Late Cursor `tool_execution_end` events now create a TUI tool card when none is pending, so a result is not rendered without a card (#1011).
- Session title generation now uses the session model's summarization auth instead of remapped compaction auth, so an explicit compaction model no longer produces `unauthenticated` Cursor title calls ([#982](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/982) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor 0-token `resource_exhausted` retries the same model after remint/compact instead of falling back to another provider, and too-small overflow compact now drops to the last user turn ([#1015](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1015) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor native `todo`/`updateTodos` calls now persist as `senpi.todo-state` even when the server resolves them without a local `op`, so the `/todo` widget no longer stays empty after a successful native todo update ([#994](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/994) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Native Cursor sessions no longer compact mid-turn while a Run is live: `compactBeforeNextAdmission` no-ops for `cursor` / `cursor-cli-oauth`, and blocking/generated compaction refuse those providers until the session is idle, so a mid-turn compact cannot poison `conversationId` and trigger 0-token `resource_exhausted` ([#986](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/986) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Native Cursor `write`/`edit` via the exec bridge now emit `tool_result` after `tool_execution_end`, so plan-touch trackers see `.omo/plans/*.md` writes and momus can unblock ([#992](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/992) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- claude-sdk-oauth stream-start-timeout retries now fork the SDK conversation at the last assistant
  boundary before the stalled turn instead of re-attaching and re-sending it, so each retry re-bills
  only the turn's own message on a prefix cache read instead of re-writing the whole conversation
  (fixes #723 retry-storm re-billing: cache writes grew ~8K per attempt, $25/6min, $1084/3days on
  worker dispatch). A stalled first turn with no boundary to fork at re-seeds byte-identically, which
  the provider serves from prefix cache after the first write. The retry watchdog cap semantics
  (`streamRetryTimeoutMs` caps the retry continuation, reconciled to the granted stream-start guard)
  are now documented on the setting itself.
- The Cursor exec bridge fails closed when a session bridge has no captured owning run, and rechecks
  run ownership after awaited preflight work so a run that ends during an approval prompt cannot start
  a tool side effect afterward ([#1002](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1002) by [@HeiTuz](https://github.com/HeiTuz)).
- Retry waits no longer animate decorative spinner frames at the default 80 ms cadence for sessions with at least 1,000 persisted entries, while the one-second countdown and small-session animation remain intact.
- Hot reload no longer stalls on filesystem watcher teardown: recursive config watchers now run in a worker thread on macOS as well as Linux, and the watch engine tears down its subscriptions off the reload critical path (measured 1.5-62s of `session_shutdown` stall eliminated). MCP server reconnect during a hot reload no longer blocks the reload either (startup behavior unchanged).
- Settings hot-reload no longer cascades across sessions that share an agent directory when another session saves a routine preference such as `defaultModel` during a reload. The replacement watcher now compares reload-window changes with the request-time settings snapshot, so routine-only writes remain suppressed while substantive configuration edits still reload ([#1006](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1006) by [@Indosaram](https://github.com/Indosaram)).
- Settings hot-reload now clears the reload handoff unconditionally after `requestReload()` settles, preventing a stale plaintext settings snapshot from surviving when the reload successor omits the config-reload builtin ([#1006](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1006) by [@Indosaram](https://github.com/Indosaram)).
- Compaction no longer treats implausible Cursor billed usage as context size: when the local transcript estimate is at least 50k and billed usage is more than 8× that estimate, the threshold uses the estimate so a multi-million dashboard-cumulative cacheRead cannot force a useless compact ([#985](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/985) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Goal continuations are no longer stripped down to the newest one on every provider request. Rewriting
  already-sent history invalidated the provider's conversation cache prefix, so a long-running team-mode
  session paid a full uncached re-read every turn and drove itself into 429 storms. Continuation history is
  now append-only and bounded by normal compaction instead of per-request deletion.
- Same-model 429 retries now floor every wait with the exponential schedule (`baseDelayMs * 2^(attempt-1)`).
  A provider that answers each rate-limit with the same tiny `retry-after` hint can no longer pin the retry
  cadence at a few milliseconds; longer provider hints still take precedence.
- Goal footer tickers no longer freeze the session TUI after a session replacement or reload: `GoalWaitTicker`
  and `GoalElapsedTicker` now retire themselves when a tick hits a retired extension context instead of
  swallowing the error and ticking against a context that can never render again, so the "Pursuing goal"
  elapsed label and the continuation-wait countdown stop freezing and the session keeps self-painting without
  an input event; a later `sync()` with a live context re-arms both tickers (#1028).
- TUI mode switches no longer freeze the session UI: the renderer swap now detaches live components instead of
  disposing them, so tool spinners, reveal animations, and extension widget intervals keep their periodic
  repaint across the switch and the TUI does not stall until the next input event (#1028).
- A vetoed or failed `/reload` no longer destroys live extension footers, task widgets, and hook statuses:
  extension UI is reset only once the reload actually proceeds, so an idle session keeps its periodic repaint
  source after a deferred or failed reload (#1028).
- Config hot-reload no longer registers whole directory subtrees with the OS watcher: recursive watch targets
  now open one non-recursive subscription per in-scope directory the scan already visits (skipping
  `node_modules`, `.git`, symlinks, and filtered paths) and reconcile subscriptions after every rescan, so an
  extensions or skills directory containing `node_modules` no longer drives `fseventsd` to 123% CPU and
  multi-GB RSS on macOS (#1041).
- Native Cursor sessions with Claude-named models no longer reject parallel tool starts as invalid event order:
  ANTML invoke recovery is skipped when `model.api === "cursor-agent"`
  ([#1013](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1013) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor turns that end as `stop` while the assistant message still contains toolCall blocks now continue so
  pending tools run, and a turn whose tool calls were all already resolved on the Cursor exec channel no longer
  re-enters the agent loop for an extra provider round-trip
  ([#1016](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1016) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- The `cursor-cli-oauth` lane now spawns with the catalog suffix variant id for explicit thinking levels
  (`claude-fable-5-thinking-low`, `gpt-5.5-extra-high`) instead of the bracket parameter form, matching the
  native lane's switch away from bare capability ids that Cursor's Run RPC rejects with
  `Connect error not_found` (#1020).
- Cursor exec tool calls that lose their owning run during an awaited preflight (for example after an approval
  prompt) now emit a `tool_execution_end` error event, so the TUI records the failed tool result instead of
  leaving a dangling tool call with a start and no end
  ([#1002](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1002) by [@HeiTuz](https://github.com/HeiTuz)).
- A Cursor turn that goes quiet after all tools have completed now ends normally instead of hanging until the
  stream idle timeout, both for native Cursor tool runs and buffered exec results
  ([#999](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/999) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor conversation-id rotation now persists under the agent directory (`CODING_AGENT_DIR` or
  `~/.senpi/agent`) instead of `$HOME/cursor-conversation-ids.json`, so a reminted wire id survives a TUI
  restart ([#998](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/998) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- A Cursor 0-token `resource_exhausted` now surfaces on the first failure of a `stream()` call so the session
  compacts before any conversation-id rotation, and a rotation skip at the 3-rotation cap remints a fresh wire
  id on the next stream instead of failing every later request with a poisoned-conversation error
  ([#998](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/998) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).

### Added

- The notice-box primitives are now part of the public API: `buildNoticeBox`, `noticeMessageRenderer`,
  `noticeEntryRenderer`, and the `NoticeSpec`/`NoticeLine`/`NoticeTone` types are exported from the package
  entry so extensions can render transcript notices in the shared visual family instead of re-implementing it.

### Changed

- Every remaining divergent transcript card now renders through the shared notice box (`customMessageBg`
  background block, bold tone title, dim body): loaded-resource conflict diagnostics, the update-available
  and package-update notifications, the risky-main-model and high-reasoning warnings, the rules banner,
  the prompt URL widget card, and the earendil announcement. Visible text is unchanged.
- The CLI no longer parses and evaluates the 1.2 MB Claude Agent SDK bundle or the jsdom/Readability/turndown
  HTML stack while starting up. Both now load on first use behind the repository's documented lazy-boundary
  pattern — the SDK when a claude-sdk-oauth stream actually opens, the HTML converters when webfetch actually
  converts an HTML response — which removes 680 modules from the startup import graph (14,203 → 13,523).
  Behavior is unchanged; only the moment the two dependencies are loaded moved.

- Every launch is one process lighter: `cli.ts` now loads the agent (`cli-main`) in its own process
  instead of re-spawning Node, unless the run actually needs an isolated process. The child spawn is
  kept byte-for-byte for the two cases that require it — an inherited Inspector option (`--inspect*`
  in exec args or `NODE_OPTIONS`), whose debugger socket must be released and re-opened in the process
  that runs the agent, and any custom exec arguments (for example `--max-old-space-size`), which only
  apply at process start and so must be replayed onto a fresh process. Brand environment scrubbing is
  unaffected: `cli-main` scrubs the variable itself, so it is scrubbed in-process before anything the
  agent spawns can inherit it. Measured on `senpi --help`: 1.206 s -> 1.131 s (-75 ms, -6.2%).

- Startup is faster after the first run: the CLI now enables Node's on-disk module compile cache
  (`enableCompileCache()`) in both `cli.ts` and `cli-main.ts` and publishes the resolved cache directory
  through `NODE_COMPILE_CACHE` so the spawned `cli-main` child process reuses it instead of re-compiling
  the full engine module graph on every launch. An existing `NODE_COMPILE_CACHE` value is never overridden,
  `NODE_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1` keeps the cache off, and runtimes without the API (the compiled binary)
  degrade to plain compilation.

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.8.19] - 2026-08-19

### Breaking Changes

### Fixed

- Implicit fallback expansion no longer routes through provider lanes that are guaranteed to refuse:
  a registered provider may declare itself ineligible (new `ProviderConfig.fallbackEligible`), and the
  cursor-cli-oauth lane does so while its `--force` acknowledgement is missing or its kill switch is
  set, as does claude-sdk-oauth under a verbatim `enabled: false`. Previously a credentialed but
  unacknowledged cursor-cli-oauth lane ranked first in the shipped `claude-opus-5` fallback chain and
  hard-errored on every hop. Explicit model selection and `/login` are unaffected.
- Auto-compaction can no longer be starved by a provider that reports a small context while the
  local transcript keeps growing (native Cursor's server-side summarized usage): the threshold
  check now takes the larger of the provider-reported context and the local transcript estimate.
- Four coding-agent test suites no longer depend on parallel-load timing: the footer git watcher, the MCP
  connection state machine, the cross-process OAuth refresh race control case, and resource-loader extension
  precedence now await the exact signal or force the interleaving they assert on. Four fixed sleeps removed.

### Added

- Tip rotation now covers persistent memory and mass-ulw graph orchestration (88 -> 113 tips). Sixteen
  memory tips explain in plain English what cross-session memory is and how to use `/remember`,
  `/search`, `/memory`, `/init`, `/people`, `/reflect`, `/dream`, `/sleeptime`, `/memfs`,
  `/memory-repository`, `/doctor`, `/facts`, and `/recompile`; nine mass-ulw tips cover dependency
  ordering, parallel waves, per-node worker categories, the `/dag` status view, and journaled resume.
  Every entry is command-gated, so the tips appear only for users whose extension registers them.

- `/loop`: recurring and self-paced scheduled prompts, ported from Claude Code as a fork-only builtin extension.
  Fixed loops re-deliver a prompt or loop-file sentinel on an interval; dynamic loops pick their own next delay via
  the new `schedule_wakeup` tool. Loops coalesce missed fires into one catch-up tick, cap at 5 active per session,
  carry a 2000-tick budget and 7-day expiry, survive restarts (shutdown suspends, session resume re-arms), and show
  a live countdown in the footer. `/loop stop|status|pause|resume` manage them.

### Changed
- Upstream sync (`badlogic/pi-mono` main@`59a71b23`): adopted cache-friendly compaction primitives, centralized compaction summary requests, compaction routing sessions, compaction usage notices, tool disabling during summarization, extension loading in Node SEA hosts, and nested markdown skill discovery. The fork's compaction affinity/request-identity split, queued-input recovery, and interactive rendering are unchanged.
- Provider/model changes from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` above apply to the CLI: xAI Responses routing with Grok 4.6 default, generalized thinking-token budgets, and the refreshed model catalog.

### Fixed

- macOS no longer shows `"senpi_pty.darwin-arm64.node" Not Opened — Apple could not verify ... is free of malware` and the CLI no longer hangs while that dialog waits. When a shipped native PTY prebuild carries the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute (npm tarballs fetched through a browser, AirDrop, or archive extraction), the loader now detects it before `dlopen()` and reports the existing `native-unavailable` diagnostic, so terminals degrade to the pipe fallback instead of blocking the process on Gatekeeper. The attribute is never stripped — that would silently disable the user's malware protection — and non-quarantined installs keep loading the real native PTY unchanged.
- The footer's git branch keeps updating in reftable repositories on systems where `fs.watch` cannot register (descriptor limits, unsupported filesystems): the `tables.list` polling fallback is now armed even when watcher creation fails, instead of being skipped by an early return ([#970](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/970)).
- Pasting multiple images in one turn now ships every image: the second and later pastes no longer write into an orphaned payload map, markers pasted in front of existing ones renumber to stay `[Image #1]`..`[Image #k]` in reading order (so `look_at("[Image #N]")` resolves to the exact image the user sees), undo after deleting a marker restores its image along with the marker, and submitting pasted images during compaction now reports the drop instead of silently discarding them.
- Subagent project-trust confirmation is kept for untrusted interactive projects while trusted projects skip it, restoring the intended trust boundary after the upstream sync.
- Post-compaction queued input flushes exactly once again after the compaction rework, and package-manager version comparison uses `semver.gt` so newer installed versions no longer trigger redundant npm update calls.

### Removed

## [2026.8.18-3] - 2026-08-18

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Pasting a clipboard image in the interactive TUI now attaches the image to the submission instead of inserting its temp file path: the composer shows an atomic `[Image #N]` marker, the bytes ride the user message as an image content part in reading order, and markers transfer between editor instances (or are stripped with their payloads dropped when the destination cannot own them).

- Cursor model listings report corrected context windows (current Claude families and GPT 5.5/5.6 at 1M,
  Grok at 500K) and the cursor-agent CLI spawn string requests the matching `context` token.

- Cursor reasoning levels now drive both Cursor surfaces: the thinking-level selector, `:suffix` model
  patterns, and favorites carry provenance into the wire request, the native protobuf lane sends per-family
  `RequestedModel.parameters`, and the `cursor-cli-oauth` lane spawns with the matching bracket or suffix
  model string. Cursor catalogs collapse the expanded variant ids into selectable identities with correct
  live-catalog context windows (Kimi K3 1M, Grok 256K, GPT 272K), while legacy variant ids, stored catalogs,
  and wildcard enabled/favorite patterns keep resolving to the new identities with their level preserved.

### Changed

### Fixed

- goal: resume an active goal when the user sends a message after a continuation-flooded session load suppressed auto-continuation; previously the "Send a message to resume" notice parked the goal because the follow-up user message only reset the continuation streak without queueing a continuation.
- session: `sendCustomMessage` with `triggerTurn` no longer waits on the session-work barrier while the session-start binding itself holds it, unblocking goal continuations queued from `session_start` handlers during resume.

- Transient provider stream-start timeouts now spend the full configured `retry.maxRetries` budget instead of
  ending the turn after a single attempt. The retry-continuation watchdog was bounded by
  `retry.provider.streamRetryTimeoutMs` (30s) while the same retry was granted the configured
  `streamStartTimeoutMs` (90s), so a slow-but-alive provider was aborted 60s before its own deadline and the
  turn surfaced `Provider stream start timed out after 90000ms` followed by `Aborted after 1 retry attempt`.
  The watchdog is now reconciled to the guard it grants, while still cancelling a retry that outlives it.
- Published Senpi tarballs now retain the lockfile-recorded Babel 8 dependency closure inside the bundled codemode sidecar, preventing `@babel/parser` resolution failures during extension startup ([#923](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/923)).
- Headless Claude SDK OAuth continuation now restores a bounded SDK lineage from a private sidecar only after its
  session marker, committed assistant, identity, and local SDK transcript all verify, so `-p -c` sends only the new
  turn while imports, forks, provider switches, rewrites, compaction, malformed state, and drift fail closed.

- Claude SDK OAuth now selects the glibc Claude Code binary before the musl variant on glibc Linux hosts and when libc detection is unavailable, while retaining musl-first selection on detected musl hosts and fallback to either installed package ([code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#6963](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/6963)).

- Messages typed while auto-compaction is running are no longer silently dropped: input submitted during `Compacting context...` is queued and delivered after compaction settles instead of being accepted and discarded. Manual `/compact` keeps rejecting unqueueable prompts as before ([#950](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/950)).

- Cursor exec-bridge dispatches are now bound to the run that opened their stream, so a straggler exec frame from a run that already ended (for example after a provider rate-limit error restarts the turn on a fallback lane) is refused instead of executing a dead run's tool inside the replacement run and leaking its lifecycle events into the new transcript.

### Removed

## [2026.8.18-2] - 2026-08-18

### Added

### Fixed

- Goals no longer stall after a settings hot-reload: a reload `session_start` now re-engages an active goal (re-arming the monitor backstop while wake sources are live, or queueing a continuation through the existing sessionStart admission) instead of parking it until the next user message; stopped goals still never auto-start on reload ([#936](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/936)).
- Cursor CLI OAuth is now available by default when its real prerequisites exist: with `cursor-agent` installed and no managed CLI account, a native `cursor` OAuth credential is copied automatically into one canonical `native` slot without modifying the primary credential; explicit `enabled: false` remains a hard opt-out, repeated/concurrent startup is idempotent, and `/login cursor` refreshes the CLI fallback in the same session ([#931](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/931)).

- Cursor exec-bridge lifecycle events now require their originating run signal and await listener delivery, preventing delayed completions from entering a replacement run or becoming detached unhandled rejections ([#935](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/935)).
- Model recovery now preserves Cursor's in-memory resolved-tool marker on native tool-call blocks, so Claude/Kimi-id
  Cursor turns do not execute server-resolved bash/write/delete calls a second time
  ([#939](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/939)).
- GPT-5.6 Sol and Sol Fast now default to a 400,000-token context window in both the direct OpenAI and
  ChatGPT OAuth (`openai-codex`) catalogs ([#933](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/933)).
- Refreshed Vercel AI Gateway pricing for `alibaba/qwen3.8-27b` from zero-value placeholder metadata to the
  current upstream input, output, and cache-read rates ([#933](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/933)).

- Extension widgets no longer change stacking order when their content updates: `setWidget` now replaces the
  component in place, so two live widgets with independent refresh timers (for example omo-senpi's `omo-task` and
  `omo-dag` status widgets) stay in a fixed vertical order instead of bouncing on every refresh
  ([#929](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/929)).

- Cursor model catalogs now become available immediately after authentication: dynamic providers perform their scoped network refresh after login, while explicit Cursor CLI fallback login/import enables the lane, `/cursor-account import native` safely copies the primary OAuth credential into managed accounts, and imported accounts refresh model availability in the current session ([#928](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/928)).

## [2026.8.17] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Added hard escalation for ignored identical tool-call loops: after two reminders, repeated calls are blocked before hooks and permissions rerun; persistent blocked calls now show an error notice, interrupt with a system abort, and start one Goal-safe recovery turn. Repeated hard stops hold Goal continuation until real input, and Cursor server-driven exec calls await lifecycle correlation before traversing the same veto
  ([#922](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/922)).
- Added `$`-driven skill invocation in the interactive composer plus typed, ordered RPC command/skill candidate,
  update, and accepted-invocation events for desktop clients
  ([#909](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/909)).

- Cursor subscription models are now fully usable: after `/login cursor` the account's model catalog is discovered automatically and Cursor chat runs over the native agent protocol with complete tool calling — Cursor's server-driven exec channel (read/bash/edit/write/grep/find/ls and MCP/extension tools) executes through the session's real tools, so approvals, sandboxing, output truncation, and tool cards behave exactly like model-issued calls ([#910](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/910)).

- `cursor-cli-oauth`: an optional fallback lane that runs Cursor subscription models through the locally installed `cursor-agent` CLI (`-p` stream-json). The native `cursor` provider stays the first-party, primary path; use this lane only when the native path does not work well (protocol drift, transport failures) or when Cursor's own agent-harness behavior is explicitly wanted. Tools execute inside the Cursor CLI with no senpi approval or sandboxing (one-time acknowledgement required); accounts live in isolated per-slot credential homes with session affinity and pre-output failover, model switching on resume keeps the same chat, and the model catalog degrades to a static list when the CLI is unavailable ([#921](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/921)).

- Added `openai-codex` `-fast` priority-tier model variants for GPT-5.6 sol/terra/luna to the catalog, mirroring the existing `openai` provider pattern ([#918](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/918)).

### Fixed

- Session reload no longer repeats a full model-availability scan when extensions re-register a provider that is already registered in a fresh snapshot. Startup registration batching defers that refresh until the one post-bind `refresh()`, so create-time leftover scans cannot leak into the next reload ([#926](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/926)).

- Cerebras no longer defaults to `zai-glm-4.7`, which the live catalog dropped. The bundled default is now `gpt-oss-120b`, which remains in both the committed snapshot and the regenerated catalog, so `npm test` after a live model-data hydrate no longer fails provider-default resolution ([#926](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/926)).

- Steering queued while a provider stream-start timeout retry is running now starts automatically when that managed
  retry exhausts its budget, instead of remaining parked until another user prompt. Generic terminal provider errors
  and user-aborted retries keep their existing queue-retention behavior
  ([#917](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/917)).
- Cursor subscription tool turns now keep long local executions alive with per-exec heartbeats and close every
  server-requested result lifecycle exactly once, preventing read, shell, MCP, and modern `pi_*` calls from leaving
  the Cursor Run stream pending until it terminates before `turnEnded`
  ([#915](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/915)).
- RPC discovery sessions no longer emit an initial `commands_changed` invalidation. Clients read the baseline through
  `get_commands`, while actual post-bind extension reloads still emit one deduplicated ordered snapshot, preventing
  command-surface refresh consumers from creating an unbounded discovery-session feedback loop
  ([#911](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/911)).
- Preserved prompt indentation and literal dollar text around explicit skill tokens, bounded adversarial token parsing
  and RPC text inputs, and prevented transformed prompt templates from emitting stale invocation metadata
  ([#909](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/909)).
- Rejected non-object RPC commands without crashing and bounded JSONL records with discard-through-newline
  resynchronization after oversized input ([#909](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/909)).

### Breaking Changes

## [2026.8.16] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- `/login cursor` signs in with a Cursor Pro/Ultra/Teams subscription: the CLI opens the Cursor browser approval deep link and polls until the tokens release, then stores and auto-refreshes them like every other OAuth provider. Cursor is authentication-only for now (its Connect-RPC chat protocol is not ported), so no Cursor models appear in pickers yet; see `docs/providers.md` ([#905](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/905)).
- Grok 4.6 prompt preset: a new `grok-4.6` system-prompt preset (full-core rewrite via the builder's `corePrompt` override) so Grok 4.6 models stop falling back to the untuned dynamic prompt. Unlike the grok-4.5 CEO/orchestrator preset, this is a direct-implementer core tuned per the Grok 4.6 launch field guide: a binding declared-stop-condition contract ("say what done means"), no exhortation language (a measured no-op on this model), a real-surface verification loop (walk the user paths the change touches; for hard-to-inspect output capture the current state, list what is wrong, fix only those), a shared-piece rule against repeated near-identical blocks, and information-dense reporting. `"grok-4.6"` joins `PromptPresetName`/`VALID_PRESETS`, the matcher resolves before 4.5, and the settings.md preset list gains both `grok-4.5` (previously missing) and `grok-4.6` ([#904](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/904)).
- `--system-prompt` and `--append-system-prompt` work again on the CLI path, and now compose with per-model prompt presets instead of being clobbered by them. A custom system prompt replaces the generated base and makes the preset step aside (the startup "Optimized system prompt applied" header also stands down); append texts are reattached after a preset replaces the base, so they survive on preset-matching models and across model switches. The CLI flags had been parsed but disconnected since 2026-07-19 because presets overwrote user overrides. Extensions can now read the user overrides via `ctx.getSystemPromptOptions()`, which moved from the command context to the base `ExtensionContext` ([#903](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/903)).
- Settings files now support dependency-free JSONC comments and trailing commas. When both `settings.jsonc` and `settings.json` exist in one config directory, JSONC wins; writes remain on the loaded file, config reload watches both formats, RPC emits `settings_source_selected` with the selected path/format/reason, and the interactive TUI shows the choice at startup or reload ([#902](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/902)).
- GLM 5.3 prompt preset: a new `glm-5.3` system-prompt preset cloned from `glm-5.2` (thin `tuningSection` wrapper over the shared dynamic core, `workstationDialect: "claude"`). The `hasGlm53Signal`/`isGlm53Model` matcher is checked before the 5.2 matcher, `"glm-5.3"` joins `PromptPresetName`/`VALID_PRESETS`, and the settings.md value list is updated. Models selecting GLM 5.3 now get the tuned system prompt instead of the untuned fallback ([#895](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/895)).

### Fixed

- Custom editors no longer lose Enter submissions when pi-tui clears live editor state before invoking `onSubmit`; editors that submit before clearing still retain their non-empty expanded value ([#908](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/908)).
- Non-interactive runs (`senpi -p`) no longer die with an uncaught `EPERM: operation not permitted, mkdir <agentDir>/auth.json.lock` when the agent dir is not writable (for example a background worker under a macOS seatbelt profile that grants only the lockfile paths). The async auth read path (`readLatestData`) now degrades lock-acquisition and read failures to last-good in-memory data with a recorded diagnostic warning, mirroring the settings-manager path that already behaved this way; OAuth write/refresh persistence remains fail-closed. proper-lockfile staleness is also unified across `FileAuthStorageBackend` (sync and async) and `FileSettingsStorage` on one shared policy (`realpath: false, stale: 30s, update: 10s` in `core/lockfile-policy.ts`), so a synchronous contender can no longer classify a still-live asynchronous lock as stale mid-update and steal it ([#898](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/898)).

- Ambient Claude SDK OAuth authentication now preserves request-scoped token overrides and explicit empty masks through stored and ambient auth replay, treats request token slots as a complete namespace so sibling host accounts cannot survive a mask, isolates request tokens from subprocess-control variables, keeps request tokens out of persistent `config-dir` credentials, remains valid across resident and auxiliary calls, recognizes request tokens in explicit ambient mode, and shares bounded availability probes without abandoned-request ownership ([#836](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/836) by [@ismetanin](https://github.com/ismetanin)).
- Explicit `/skill:<name>` commands now preserve that the user selected the skill: the expanded user message names each invoked skill, marks its workflow as binding, and separates skill instructions from trailing request text. The TUI and HTML export parsers recognize the new payload while retaining legacy parsing for resumed and imported sessions, so skill invocations remain collapsed in transcripts. Previously the expansion flattened both into ordinary prose, so the Intent Gate could route only on the trailing request and ignore the selected skill's rules ([#890](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/890)).
- The model selector no longer chronically warns `Could not refresh opengateway; showing cached models.` and `senpi update --models` no longer fails when an `opengateway` (or `alibaba-token-plan`) credential is configured. Both fork-only builtin providers were wrapped with the pi.dev remote-catalog overlay like every other builtin, but pi.dev is upstream infrastructure that does not serve fork-only provider ids and answers them with a non-404 failure — retried on every refresh because transient failures never persist `lastModified`, so the freshness throttle never engaged. The overlay wrap is now skipped for fork-only providers under the default catalog base URL (a custom `catalogBaseUrl` keeps it); their catalogs remain baked at build time ([#887](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/887), [#888](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/888)).
- An admission compaction that is aborted mid-flight no longer floods the session with errors or blocks the message that triggered it. The OpenAI remote-compaction route used to leak a raw `Request was aborted` throw out of the `session_before_compact` handler (rendered as `Extension "<builtin:compaction>" error` with a full stack, and as a red `Compaction failed: Request was aborted` line on the blocking route), and the admission layer treated the aborted attempt like a failed one, throwing `Context remains above the compaction threshold because compaction did not complete` at the caller (surfaced as `Runtime error (send_message)` on resumed sessions where a queued extension message races the user's own prompt). Aborted remote compactions now stand down silently, and when the abort came from a newer superseding compaction claim, admission proceeds quietly and lets the live claimant re-gate the session — matching the established breaker-cooldown and SDK-delegation semantics. User-initiated cancels keep today's behavior ([#886](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/886)).

- Compaction no longer wedges when providers reject the summarization request for its size. Gateway HTTP 413 body-size rejections now route into the overflow shrink-retry (geometric halving, bounded attempts) and exhaust into the deterministic fallback, the summarization request's turn order is normalized so strict-alternation providers (Gemini's `function call turn must come immediately after a user turn` 400) accept it, and request sizing counts CJK text at its real token density so Korean-heavy sessions stop sending oversized first attempts. Previously every fallback-chain model failed the same oversized request and the session stuck on `Compaction rejected: compaction generator failed` ([#884](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/884)).
- Multi-session RPC no longer amplifies a streaming answer into hundreds of megabytes of stdout, which made
  clients freeze and then render walls of text at once. Each `message_update` carried a full cumulative snapshot,
  so a single 96-second answer measured 140 MB on the wire (median line 72 KB, peak 95 KB) for 12 KB of assistant
  content. Superseded snapshots pending in a session queue are now demoted to `message: null` /
  `assistantMessageEvent.partial: null` and adjacent same-index text/thinking/toolcall deltas merge, while
  `tool_execution_update` keeps only the latest record per `toolCallId`; every boundary, delta-only, error,
  lifecycle, UI-request and response record stays untouched, so no assistant transition is lost. The event writer
  also drains single-flight - one complete record in flight at a time, round-robin fairness preserved, host control
  responses routed through their own non-coalescing lane, and shutdown flushing the writer before stdout. Classic
  single-session RPC is unchanged and now pinned by regression tests, including its per-event backpressure
  ([#881](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/881)).
- The ambient Claude auth availability probe now passes `windowsHide: true` when spawning `claude auth status`, so the background check no longer opens a console window on Windows ([#871](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/871) by [@grim-susemi](https://github.com/grim-susemi)).
- `senpi --help` now lists the `PI_RULES_DISABLED`, `PI_RULES_MAX_RULE_CHARS`, and `PI_RULES_MAX_RESULT_CHARS` environment settings that the built-in rules extension reads, so the two environment-only character limits are discoverable from the CLI ([#681](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/681) by [@Yoonkeee](https://github.com/Yoonkeee)).
- Windows shutdown no longer dies with an uncaught `Error: spawn taskkill ENOENT` when `%SystemRoot%\System32` is
  missing from PATH. The tracked-detached-child kill now tries every absolute `System32` / `Sysnative` `taskkill.exe`
  before the PATH-resolved name, runs synchronously so a shutdown that exits in the same tick still terminates the
  tree, and degrades to killing the direct child only when no launcher starts at all
  ([#807](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/807) by [@yeongjunyoo](https://github.com/yeongjunyoo)).


- MCP shutdown no longer risks terminating unrelated processes on macOS when Homebrew `proctools` provides `pgrep`: process-tree collection now passes an explicit match-all pattern, and the kill path skips PID 1 and non-positive PIDs as defense in depth ([#824](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/824) by [@bagelcode-jhkim](https://github.com/bagelcode-jhkim)).
- `claude-sdk-oauth` sessions no longer re-send the full conversation after a transient content-less user message disappears. Such messages are now excluded from the sent-stream continuity hash, so an unchanged conversation stays a `delta` instead of forking with `sent_stream_diverged` ([#791](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/791) by [@1vivy](https://github.com/1vivy)).
- `config-reload` now accepts an extension watch rooted at the agent directory when every `filterGlob` is root-anchored and non-protected, so extensions can live-watch safe root config files such as `omo.jsonc`. Unfiltered targets, unanchored filters, and protected paths (`auth.json`, `sessions/`, `logs/`) remain rejected ([#819](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/819)).

- An active Goal no longer auto-continues in a loop when the `claude-sdk-oauth` account-rotating proxy reports that every account is exhausted. The zero-token `stop` response is now classified as a terminal provider error, so the Goal blocks and resumes on the next user message instead of queueing repeated failed requests ([#748](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/748)).

- A failed compaction now reports the concrete reason — for example `Compaction did not apply: remote-compaction-timeout; local fallback unavailable` — instead of the generic `Compaction did not apply`, so the cause is diagnosable in the TUI and decision log ([#765](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/765)).

- Expanding several tool results at once (Ctrl+O) no longer renders mismatched or truncated content when a frame grows above the viewport. The viewport-remap path now replays rows above the visible window so cached component layout and terminal output stay aligned ([#701](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/701), [#879](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/879)).

- Fallback retries no longer escalate reasoning. A requested level the fallback model does not support previously resolved to that model's highest supported level, which pushed 191 of 197 always-on models to maximum reasoning on unattended retries; it now clamps to the nearest supported level. A session interrupted inside a fallback window also no longer resumes with the primary model carrying the fallback model's reasoning level, and favorite model patterns keep their `:level` / `:priority` decorators instead of being flattened to bare ids ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).


### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Each model now remembers its own reasoning level and service tier. Cycling favorites (ctrl+p) or switching models restores the level you last used for that model, persisted across restarts via the new `modelThinkingLevels` and `modelServiceTiers` settings. Model patterns also accept a service-tier decorator (`provider/id:priority`) alongside the existing `:level` form ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- `/reasoning [on|off]` shows or toggles reasoning for the current model, with behavior tailored to the model's capability class: models without reasoning support, always-on models, on/off-only models, and fully graded models each get a specific response. `/reasoning on` restores the level you last used for that model ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- `/efforts [minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max]` shows or sets the reasoning effort ladder for graded models. On/off-only models are told to use `/reasoning` instead; models without reasoning support are informed plainly. Both commands work headless and over RPC ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- `/fast [on|off]` now persists per model. The choice survives restarts via the `modelServiceTiers` setting; `off` records an explicit `"auto"` so it overrides a catalog-inherited priority tier. A `-fast` catalog variant and its base model share one entry, preventing contradictory preferences ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- RPC `model_changed` event emitted on every active-model change (any source), carrying the model object, the post-switch thinking level, and the change source ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- RPC `service_tier_changed` event emitted when the effective service tier or fast-mode state changes ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- RPC `get_state` now includes `serviceTier` and `fastMode` fields reflecting what the next request would carry ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- RPC `set_fast_mode` / `get_fast_mode` commands for toggling and reading fast mode over the protocol, with per-model persistence and the same error semantics as `/fast` ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).
- RPC `set_thinking_level` with `scope: "turn"` now validates the requested level against the active model before applying it; a rejected request leaves the session level unchanged ([#894](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/894)).

### Changed

- Synced with upstream v0.84.2: `--use-theme` per-run theme selection, configurable default tools, managed-tool startup status, collapsed fallback tool output, and upstream's settings storage/locking rewrite are now available, alongside the fork's retry/fallback, compaction and PTY settings. Configured default tools now also filter the fork's builtin-extension tools, which previously bypassed the setting entirely ([#892](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/892)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.14] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Extension selectors (including the `/fallback` model picker) now window long option lists around the
  highlighted row instead of rendering every entry. On large model registries the full list overflowed the
  viewport and the moved highlight was never painted, so arrow keys and j/k appeared to do nothing even
  though the selection moved ([#795](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/795)).

- The shipped `claude-fable-5` fallback chain now reaches Kimi K3 on providers that expose the
  model as `kimi-k3` (for example OpenCode Go), via an explicit `kimi-k3:max` entry. The
  conservative family matcher is unchanged, so `k3` still cannot capture arbitrary ids
  ([#793](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/793)).

- Sessions on the `claude-sdk-oauth` lane no longer fail with `Context remains above the compaction
  threshold because compaction did not complete` or fatal print-mode exits when the SDK owns
  compaction. Senpi now recognizes the lane's external-owner rejection and lets the admitted query
  compact natively; rejected compactions no longer force a cache-losing resident-session restart,
  and the lane now pins the SDK's native auto-compaction on
  ([#874](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/874)).
  **Note:** `compaction_end` / `session_compact` events may now carry
  `rejectionCause: "external-owner"`. This is additive for well-formed consumers, but consumers
  exhaustively matching the rejection-cause union should add the new case.

### Removed

## [2026.8.13-2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- A session reload no longer crashes the CLI while a compaction idle warm-up retry is pending. The warm-up watcher
  armed after a transient summarization failure kept reading its `ExtensionContext` after `reload()` retired that
  extension generation, and the resulting `stale extension generation after reload` escaped as an unhandled
  rejection from the failure continuation and as an `uncaughtException` from the armed retry timer, killing the
  process. The watcher now stands down on `session_shutdown` and re-checks that its generation is still live before
  either continuation touches the context
  ([#866](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/866)).

- Every registry package source is now private, and every scripted release-publication entrypoint fails
  closed outside the trusted GitHub Actions path, preventing direct or scripted npm publication without
  provenance attestations.

- The compaction prepared while your session sat idle is now reused no matter which internal path runs
  the compaction. Previously the path that runs first on a new prompt threw that finished summary away
  and summarized again while you waited, so the idle head start was wasted in exactly the case it was
  built for.

### New Features

### Removed

## [2026.8.13] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Idle compaction warm-ups are no longer wasted. A summary prepared while the session was idle is
  now applied when the history it summarized is unchanged, instead of being discarded because
  unrelated messages arrived during the wait. Sessions parked in a cache-warm wait no longer pay a
  second full compaction the moment you send your next message
  ([#853](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/853)).

- Provider stream stalls (`Provider stream start timed out after <n>ms` and `Idle timeout waiting for
  provider stream after <n>ms`) now use the same bounded retry budget as every other transient provider
  error instead of giving up after a single same-model attempt, so a turn no longer ends with
  `Retry failed after 1 attempts` while `retry.maxRetries` is 3. Retries also keep the configured provider
  timeouts rather than shrinking them to `retry.provider.streamRetryTimeoutMs`, which had turned a configured
  90s stream-start budget into 30s on the retry; that setting still bounds the retry continuation itself
  ([#845](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/845)).

- Historical image replay can now be capped with `images.maxHistoricalImages`, preserving every
  image in the active turn while replacing only older request-payload images with the existing
  recoverable elision marker. Persisted session history is unchanged, and removing the setting
  restores the previous replay behavior.

- Upstream fixes picked up in the v0.84.1 sync:
  - LaTeX blocks in markdown render without corrupting surrounding text, and Kitty terminal
    detection/key handling no longer misfires on non-Kitty terminals.
  - Windows terminal input handles bracketed paste and modifier keys correctly, and truecolor
    output is detected reliably instead of falling back to 256 colors.
  - `Agent.reset` now rejects while a run is active instead of silently clobbering in-flight
    state, so callers get a clear error instead of a corrupted session.
  - When a blocked tool call is denied, the run terminates cleanly rather than leaving the
    agent waiting on a tool result that will never arrive.

- Cache-warm Goal wait and wake entries now show the expected UTC completion time while retaining
  the planned or actual elapsed duration in parentheses; RPC entry consumers receive the same
  authoritative `dueAtMs` timestamp.

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- App-server clients can now receive extension-owned `extension_event` notifications and call loaded-thread
  `extension_request` handlers, bringing both directions of the opt-in `pi.rpc` channel to app/editor integrations
  ([#838](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/838)).

### Changed

- Synced the coding-agent, AI, TUI, session, storage, and supporting workspace packages through
  upstream `pi-mono` v0.84.1. The merge adopts configurable default tools, streaming-usage
  preservation, session-backend consolidation, OAuth/provider updates, model-catalog refreshes,
  TUI/input fixes, and release tooling improvements while retaining Senpi extension APIs,
  app-server RPC events, multi-session routing, fork-specific retry/compaction behavior, and the
  OmO integration boundary. User-facing changes from the sync:
  - The default tool set is now configurable, so setups can trim or extend which built-in tools
    an agent starts with instead of always getting the fixed list.
  - Session persistence is consolidated onto a single session backend; the separate legacy
    storage paths are gone and existing sessions keep working through the unified backend.
  - Auth checks and provider OAuth flows were reworked: credential validity is verified up
    front, and provider OAuth logins refresh and store tokens more predictably.
  - Sampling requests to deferred providers now resolve the provider lazily at call time, so
    models from providers that finish auth or registration late are still usable in the same
    session.
  - The TUI can run fullscreen, text selection works inside it, and the terminal is restored
    correctly on exit.
  - The TUI can be switched at runtime, and a linear JSON output mode is available for
    non-interactive consumers that want a flat event stream.
  - Telemetry hooks landed upstream; the fork keeps its existing opt-in posture, and no data
    leaves the machine without explicit configuration.
  - Baseten joins the provider catalog and the Qwen model entries were refreshed to the current
    lineup.

### Removed

## [2026.8.12-4] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Transient summarization failures on the blocking compaction route now spend a bounded retry budget instead of
  ending the compaction on the first attempt, so an upstream `500` (observed: `Compaction failed: 500 Worker exceeded memory
  limit.`) recovers the way the core `compact()` route already does. Speculative warm-ups keep their own idle retry,
  and failures with a deterministic zero-LLM recovery still skip retrying ([#834](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/834)).

- Favorite models are no longer erased from settings when a favorite's provider is
  momentarily unauthenticated or unreachable. Both selectors list only models that
  resolve against the current availability snapshot, and persisting that view
  overwrote the stored patterns, permanently dropping every favorite that did not
  resolve at that moment (and removing the `favoriteModels` key entirely when nothing
  resolved). Stored patterns that resolve to no model are now preserved on persist.
  ([#833](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/833))

### Fixed

- Claude SDK OAuth accounts saved by senpi's own login are now injected into the
  spawned Claude Code subprocess by default. The default `tokenInjection` lane
  was `ambient` (a review-time hold from `606aa052b`), so stored accounts were
  ignored unless explicitly configured, causing every query to fail with
  "Failed to authenticate: OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed"
  on machines where `claude auth status` is logged out
  ([#828](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/828),
  oh-my-openagent#6784).

- Bun global installs no longer let a sibling `signal-exit@4` shadow the
  callable `signal-exit@3` required by `proper-lockfile`, preventing
  `TypeError: onExit is not a function` during Senpi and `omo` startup
  ([#829](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/829)).

  while preserving the distinction between an editor that failed to launch
  and one that launched and exited unsuccessfully
  ([#827](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/827)).

- `/btw` side queries now budget captured session context against the selected model's window instead of replaying the
  full snapshot, so large sessions no longer fail with a context-window overflow ([#826](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/826)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.11-4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Standalone Bun release archives now embed the default-on `senpi-codemode`
  factory and ship its worker/prelude package assets beside the executable, so
  launches outside the repository no longer depend on `$bunfs` package lookup,
  warn that `<builtin:codemode>` is unavailable, or silently lose `eval`.
  The relocation smoke now verifies codemode through RPC instead of checking
  only `--help` and `--version`; clean package-level binary builds also compile
  the PTY workspace before coding-agent instead of depending on stale
  declarations, and embed `css-tree` so relocated binaries do not fail while
  resolving that package from `$bunfs`
  ([#818](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/818)).

## [2026.8.11-3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Terminal monitor wake budgets now treat widely spaced progress as separate bursts instead of eventually pausing,
  while a true budget pause immediately steers the main session even when ordinary notifications wait for the next
  turn ([#815](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/815)).
- Model switches no longer fail before generation when persisted tool-call IDs contain provider-specific characters
  such as the colon in Kimi's `eval:18`; replay now preserves call/result pairing while satisfying strict
  Anthropic-backed gateway constraints ([#810](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/810)).
- Gateway/provider failures reported as `The model request was rejected. Check the request and try again.` now retry
  the current model according to `settings.retry` before the configured fallback chain is used
  ([#806](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/806)).
- `/goal resume` can explicitly reactivate a completed goal and queue its continuation, while completed goals remain
  excluded from automatic restart-resume prompts ([#802](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/802)).
- A launch from a deleted working directory (for example a removed worktree) no longer crashes during
  startup with `uv_cwd`; the CLI recovers into the home directory before any dependency evaluates
  `process.cwd()` ([#799](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/799)).
- `claude-sdk-oauth` is now skipped as an unauthenticated fallback candidate on a managed lane
  (`oauth-slots`/`config-dir`) when no account is logged in, instead of always counting as configured because its
  stored credential is a zero-account sentinel. The ambient lane is unchanged and still defers to the spawned
  Claude Code engine ([#804](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/804)).
- Claude SDK OAuth models are selected as fallback candidates only when a stored account, environment token, or
  authenticated ambient Claude CLI is usable. Empty sentinel credentials and logged-out local CLIs are skipped, and
  fallback responses carrying errors such as `Not logged in` cannot emit an immediate or delayed green
  `Fallback model responded` notice ([#803](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/803)).
- Route Anthropic provider-native refusal fallbacks through the configured Senpi chain after an active-turn model
  change, instead of persisting the server-selected substitute because the run retained the previous model's policy
  ([#796](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/796)).

### New Features

- Multi-session RPC clients can read loaded extensions and live MCP server inventory with
  `get_loaded_surfaces`, and receive `loaded_surfaces_changed` invalidations when skills, extensions, or MCP
  inventory changes ([#805](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/805)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added the `openai-image-gen` native builtin: when the active model uses the OpenAI Responses API on
  `api.openai.com`, senpi injects the `image_generation` server tool and strips the client-side
  `generate_image` function tool so exactly one image surface is offered per request. Mid-session model
  switches re-evaluate the gate. Azure Responses endpoints default to the client tool unless
  `compat.supportsImageGeneration` opts in
  ([#814](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/814)).
- Native image results are externalized before persistence: a `message_end` handler decodes each
  completed `image_generation_call` block, writes the image to `generated-images/`, and replaces the
  provider-native block with a text path reference. Base64 payloads never reach the session file
  ([#814](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/814)).
- Added a credential-gated `generate_image` tool: when an OpenAI-compatible credential exists (a stored OpenAI
  key, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or a configured OpenAI-compatible gateway provider), the agent can generate images with
  `gpt-image-2` saved as files (never overwriting existing ones); without credentials the tool returns structured
  setup guidance instead of failing ([#813](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/813)).
- Added a conditionally contributed `gpt-image-gen` skill with a detailed prompt-crafting guide that is listed
  only while image-generation credentials exist ([#813](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/813)).
- **Extension Tool Search**: Extension tools can opt into a shared searchable catalog by setting
  `exposure: "search"` on `pi.registerTool()`. Searchable tools stay inactive and cost zero prompt tokens until the
  model finds them with the shared `tool_search` tool, which promotes matches into the active set for the next model
  request ([#811](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/811)).

### Changed

## [2026.8.11-2] - 2026-08-10

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Distributions repackaging senpi can set their own product identity through a `SENPI_BRAND` profile: name, display
  version, config directory (optionally flat), environment prefix, wire identity and update channel. The profile is
  consumed and scrubbed at startup, so nested senpi processes keep the engine identity. A standalone install is
  unchanged ([#783](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/783)).
- Product settings are read across the brand prefix and the legacy `SENPI_`/`PI_` prefixes, so existing environments
  keep working after a rebrand ([#783](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/783)).
- A branded install checks its own release channel for updates, and the update notice, changelog link and self-update
  paths point at the distribution's own command instead of `senpi update`
  ([#783](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/783)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Windows pipe-fallback shutdown no longer crashes with an uncaught `spawn taskkill ENOENT` when the helper cannot
  resolve. Senpi now invokes `taskkill.exe` explicitly and falls back to direct child termination if helper startup
  fails ([#792](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/792)).
- A brand profile carrying an unsafe `configDir` (a path separator, `.` or `..`) is rejected instead of redirecting
  agent state and its migration outside the intended directory
  ([#787](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/787)).
- A branded install without an update channel no longer falls back to checking the engine's own releases, which it
  cannot install ([#787](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/787)).
- Prevented an asynchronous goal continuation from restoring a goal after `thread/goal/clear` or recording delivery
  against a replacement goal ([#788](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/788)).
- Prevented Claude Agent SDK OAuth sessions from scheduling `assistant_rewritten` forks when only host-side thinking
  timing annotations changed, preserving resident-session and prompt-cache continuity for reasoning-heavy turns
  ([#751](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/751) by [@goldtg](https://github.com/goldtg)).

### Removed

- Removed the OmO-specific footer badge, its detection module, and the `isOmoNative` provider surface. Downstream packages contribute footer content through the supported `ctx.ui.setStatus` extension API instead, so no product-specific markers live in the coding agent.

## [2026.8.10] - 2026-08-10

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added `pi.registerFilesystemPolicy()` for extensions. Policies receive a canonicalized path plus operation (`read`, `enumerate`, or `write`) and tool name, compose deny-wins below permission hooks, and are enforced by the built-in `read`, `write`, `edit`, `ls`, `find`, and `grep` tools. Denials surface as ordinary tool errors carrying the policy reason, and hosts without any registered policy behave exactly as before. The runner also exposes aggregated denied-root metadata for future sandbox backends.

### Changed

### Removed

## [2026.8.9-2] - 2026-08-09

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added opt-in native Anthropic prompt-cache keep-alive pings, disabled by default and bounded per session by request and estimated-cost caps. Idle pings stay dormant while any Goal continuation wait is armed and render as `⚡ Warm ping #N` transcript entries.

- Added provider-native prompt-cache identity and first-request affinity for the interactive agent: Moonshot/Kimi Chat
  Completions now send `prompt_cache_key`, while OpenRouter sends both `x-session-id` and the request body's `session_id`
  so repeated turns consistently target the same upstream cache lane.

- Goal continuation now aggregates terminal monitors, background terminal sessions, detached eval cells, and other producers through the shared `wake_source_state` contract. Scheduled/resumed telemetry keeps `activeMonitorCount` as the aggregate compatibility field and adds a per-source `wakeSources` snapshot.

- Goal cache-warm wait and wake entries now show an in-memory iteration number for each accepted monitor cycle, resetting when the Goal or wake epoch changes while remaining compatible with legacy persisted entries.

### Changed

- Goal monitor continuation backstops now derive from the active model's prompt-cache safe-wait budget instead of a fixed four-minute delay, capped by `promptCache.goalBackstopMaxSeconds` (default 3570 seconds). Held direct-input admission now consumes wall-clock time, and cache-warm notices no longer claim warmth or savings after the cache TTL may have elapsed.

- Expanded explicit OpenRouter prompt-cache markers beyond Anthropic model names to Qwen and Google prefixes, including
  catalog IDs with one leading `~`, so those provider families reuse the intended cache boundary instead of sending
  otherwise equivalent prompts without cache-control markers.

### Fixed

- Fixed active goals becoming stranded when the final wake source drained: an armed monitor wait now fires after a one-second micro-grace even at zero active sources. Activating a goal through app-server `thread/goal/set` also queues work for an otherwise idle session.

- Fixed provider cache accounting and TTL reporting used by Senpi's status, cost, and cache-warm decisions: flat Kimi
  `usage.cached_tokens` now counts as cache-read tokens; Bedrock requests one-hour retention only for Claude Opus 4.5,
  Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5 while other cacheable Claude models stay at five minutes; and the Claude SDK OAuth lane now
  reports its SDK-managed cache lifetime as 300 seconds.
- Fixed Anthropic prompt-cache pre-warming importing the Anthropic SDK before Senpi knew whether the selected model
  supported warming. Unsupported providers now remain dependency-lazy, while supported Anthropic models preserve the
  same zero-output warm request and normalized cache-usage accounting.

- Fixed a full session freeze when four or more long-lived background terminal sessions were active. Each native terminal
  `waitExit()` previously parked one of the four default libuv workers on a blocking thread join for the child's lifetime,
  starving all later fs/DNS work so provider requests died as `Request timed out.` and the turn pipeline wedged with input
  dead. Native waits are now settled from a dedicated reaper thread, keeping the libuv pool free; synchronous wait errors,
  exit payloads, and process-tree kill behavior are unchanged. Added native regression coverage for threadpool exhaustion
  and Worker teardown ([#768](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/768)).
- Fixed threshold-triggered compaction giving up with "Compaction did not apply" when an idle-warmed summary became stale after a message-revision change. The blocking route now discards the stale warm result and regenerates a fresh summary against the current session instead of allowing context to keep growing.

- Recovered malformed Claude tool-call text that starts with an angle-less
  `antml:invoke` and ends with a stray `</function_results>`, so Senpi executes
  the validated call once without printing internal protocol markup.

### Removed

## [2026.8.9] - 2026-08-09

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

- Slash commands provided by extensions (`/todo`, `/goal`, `/help`, `/mcp`, and every
  other registered command) now run the moment you press Enter, even while the agent
  is mid-turn or compacting. Previously they were held until the turn finished
  whenever a queued continuation (such as an active goal chain) owned the session,
  so `/todo` appeared to do nothing until the agent stopped working.
- `/ir` now refuses to switch sessions while the agent is working or compacting,
  reporting that it is unavailable instead of aborting the in-flight run.

- Changed the shipped default model-fallback chain from a provider-pinned literal
  (`anthropic/claude-fable-5` -> `apitopia/kimi-k3-unlocked:max`, `anthropic/claude-opus-5:xhigh`,
  `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:xhigh`) to provider-agnostic model families
  (`claude-fable-5` -> `k3:max`, `claude-opus-5:xhigh`, `claude-opus-4-8:xhigh`) that expand against the live
  model registry. Fable 5 now keeps a working fallback chain no matter which provider serves it - the builtin
  Anthropic provider, the Claude SDK OAuth extension, a gateway, or Bedrock - instead of silently losing the
  chain and leaving provider-side fallback aborted with nothing to fall back to. Bare selectors expand to at most two
  providers, preferring OAuth credentials, then API keys, then a fixed provider precedence, and never OpenRouter.
  Candidates now resolve only through usable models, and `/fallback` hides family expansions that are unavailable or
  excluded by the active selectable-model filter instead of advertising dead routes. Explicit `provider/model` chains
  keep exact behavior, and `retry.fallbackChains` accepts a bare model id as a family-wide key with `[]` still opting
  out ([#761](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/761)).
- Changed `/model` search ranking to a model-aware scorer that matches query tokens against the model id, name,
  provider, and `provider/id` independently instead of one concatenated string. Exact, whole-token, and
  word-boundary matches now beat scattered subsequence matches, so `opus 5` ranks `claude-opus-5` first and an exact
  `provider/id` query still outranks proxy providers that merely reuse the id. Favorite models are ranked above
  non-favorites in `/model` search results, with relevance preserved inside each group.

### Fixed

- Fixed the model rows jumping while toggling favorites. `/model` and `/favorite-models` now freeze their row order
  when the screen opens: toggling a favorite only updates the `*` marker, and the order is recomputed the next time
  the screen is opened. Explicit reorder keys still move rows immediately.

- Fixed config reloads discarding live terminal monitor and background-bash snapshots before Goal continuation
  scheduling. Fresh Goal instances now retain Terminal's pre-start replay, while later same-instance session starts
  still clear stale channel state.
- Fixed `senpi --session <id>` hanging indefinitely with no output when the session belongs to a different project and
  the run is not interactive (piped, detached, app-server spawns, and `-p` one-shots started from a terminal). The
  cross-project fork confirmation is now gated on the resolved application mode instead of stdin alone and fails fast
  with actionable guidance (`--fork '<id>'` or re-run interactively from the owning project), and the confirmation
  prompt resolves as "no" on stdin EOF instead of wedging the process
  ([#756](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/756)).
- Fixed terminal resumption liveness reporting so monitor snapshots are dual-published through the legacy event and
  the shared source-keyed channel contract, while live background bash sessions now publish spawn, exit, kill, and
  session-start snapshots even when terminal completion notifications are disabled.
- Fixed active Goals resuming immediately while background tasks, detached evals, or background bash sessions were
  still live. Goal continuation now aggregates source-keyed resumption-channel snapshots, preserves the four-minute
  cache-warm check-in, and reports a per-source wait summary while retaining terminal-monitor telemetry compatibility.
- Fixed the pipe-fallback terminal backend letting shell children take over the user's terminal. When no native PTY
  prebuild is available, `bash` children ran inside senpi's own session, so a tty-reading program (such as a `sudo`
  password prompt) opened `/dev/tty` and raced the TUI's raw-mode stdin reader - the password swallowed stolen escape
  bytes and the editor then showed Kitty key-release fragments like `[49;1:3u` as literal text (reported on Ubuntu +
  kitty). Pipe-fallback children are now detached on POSIX with no controlling terminal, and `kill()` signals the whole
  process group so backgrounded grandchildren can no longer hold the output pipe open
  ([#758](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/758)).
- Fixed multi-session RPC `open_session` failures returning only a bare `open_failed` code. Responses now preserve the
  stable prefix and include the underlying workspace or runtime cause as `open_failed: <reason>`, while all other
  transport error codes remain exact strings ([#750](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/750)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.7] - 2026-08-07

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

- Changed the `bash` tool so a long-running foreground command is handed to a live background session instead of
  blocking the turn or being killed. Foreground blocking now stops at a fixed window (`PI_BASH_FOREGROUND_SECONDS`,
  default 60s) rather than tracking the prompt-cache budget, and `timeout` becomes the process kill deadline
  (default 1800s) enforced after the hand-off. Commands whose purpose is waiting — a bare `sleep 30`,
  `sleep 45; gh pr view ...`, or a `while`/`for` poll loop — detach after 5s and report back with guidance to end the
  turn and wait for the completion notification, or to use `monitor({ command, filter })` for output-pattern waits;
  short settle sleeps such as `pkill; sleep 1` still run in the foreground. Sessions started with
  `run_in_background: true` are unchanged ([#747](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/747)).
- Changed the turn-completion TPS notice from a dense list of raw input, output, cache-read, cache-write, and total-token
  counters to `TPS <rate> tok/s. Cache hit <rate>%, <seconds>s`. The cache-hit percentage is aggregated across every
  assistant message in the completed turn as `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead + cacheWrite)`, reports `0.0%` when the
  turn has no cache reads, and keeps tool and permission waits out of the elapsed-time calculation
  ([#742](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/742)).

### Fixed

- Fixed a 429/rate-limit failure without a retry-after hint killing the turn with "Retry failed after 0 attempts"
  when no fallback chain was usable for the active model. Such failures now degrade to same-model in-turn retries on
  the ordinary exponential schedule, hinted waits below the probe-back ceiling retry in-turn clamped to
  `retry.hintedWaitCapMs`, hour-plus hinted waits name the provider-requested wait in the final error, and retry
  exhaustion reports the true attempt count ([#744](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/744)).

## [2026.8.6] - 2026-08-06

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed system-owned TTSR interruptions being recorded as user interruptions, which could block an active Goal even
  while a background child or monitor could still resume the run. System-owned provider-error shells and consecutive
  remediation generations now retain system provenance, while a late Escape cancels corrective and provider-retry
  work through `agent_settled` even when it arrives after TTSR or extension dispatch. Settlement-triggered messages
  are held until every handler completes and discarded on cancellation, with Goal's single-flight admission released
  so `/goal resume` can recover normally. A terminal system error with no retry or monitor now launches a guarded
  Goal-owned recovery after settlement instead of leaving an active Goal idle, and any guard that blocks that
  recovery immediately updates accounting and the visible Goal status. Stream-rule
  and Goal cache-warm status now render through one durable notice owner instead of duplicate transient and persisted UI messages
  ([#733](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/733)).
- Fixed required compaction fatally ending a turn once the per-turn soft cap (3 accepted or ineffective
  compactions) was reached. Compaction admission is now bounded only by the absolute session cap (10) and the
  failure circuit breaker, so long turns that legitimately need more than three compactions keep running
  ([#731](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/731), superseding
  [#728](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/728)).
- Fixed interactive shutdown crashing with `setRawMode failed with errno: 5` when an SSH or PTY peer disappears before
  terminal raw-mode restoration. Senpi now completes the requested exit for dead terminals without hiding unexpected
  restoration failures ([#726](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/726)).
- Fixed `apply_patch` binary-file previews so delete and move operations render a concise marker instead of
  decoded byte garbage, with move-only patches preserving the original bytes
  ([#725](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/725)).
- Fixed client-policy server fallback aborts rendering both a refusal-shaped assistant `Error:` row and the dedicated
  fallback notice box. Diagnosed aborts now leave the notice box as the single visible explanation while preserving
  the original message diagnostics and incremental render-cache updates
  ([#724](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/724)).

  and `--version`.

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Brought GitHub binary installs up to parity with npm for paused terminal monitors: after the wake budget suppresses
  noisy line updates, the same monitor's terminal completion, timeout, or kill summary now clears the notifier pause
  and prior rate limit, resets the monitor-only wake streak, and wakes the session automatically without
  `monitor({ action: "rearm" })` or another wake-budget charge. Intermediate events remain suppressed until rearm,
  and the pause notice now makes that distinction explicit ([#717](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/717)).
- Fixed provider transport-timeout retries remaining indefinitely Working when both
  ordinary stream guards were disabled; retry continuations now abort only their
  captured Agent run at the configured retry cap, settle the session, and leave
  later prompts/takeovers untouched ([#719](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/719)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible tool calls failing when an object-shaped root combiner lost its required
  `type: "object"`, and fixed Moonshot normalization dropping root-declared properties while merging
  object-shaped root `anyOf`/`oneOf` schemas. Scalar and mixed root unions remain unchanged instead of being
  mislabeled as objects ([#718](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/718)).
- Fixed Anthropic receiving object-shaped root `anyOf`/`oneOf` tools with an empty parameter map. Senpi now merges
  their properties and computes top-level required names before constructing Anthropic `input_schema`, while
  preserving ordinary object schemas ([#718](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/718)).
- Stopped retrying recognized malformed tool/function schema errors on the same model when gateways wrap them in
  retryable-looking 5xx responses. With auto-retry enabled and a configured candidate, eligible error-only turns
  switch immediately to that fallback; without a candidate they settle after the first call, while generic
  transient server errors remain retryable ([#718](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/718)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.4-2] - 2026-08-04

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added Claude SDK OAuth full-prompt payload telemetry: flatten and bootstrap continuity diagnostics now carry
  the UTF-8 byte size of serialized text blocks and the number of duplicate `<ultrawork-mode>` directives removed,
  while interactive flatten notices render the transmitted size in B, KB, or MB and include the collapsed count
  when it is non-zero ([#705](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/705)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed paused terminal monitors discarding their own completion summary and forcing
  repeated wake-budget rearms; completion now wakes the session automatically while
  intermediate line noise remains suppressed ([#717](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/717)).
- Fixed release preparation failing after Groq replaced `qwen/qwen3-32b` with the multimodal
  `qwen/qwen3.6-27b`: Senpi's generated model catalog and typed request regression now follow the active model,
  preserve Groq's `none`/`default` reasoning controls, and include the reviewed live provider metadata refresh so
  `senpi --list-models` and release-time validation agree
  ([#716](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/716)).
- Fixed Claude SDK OAuth full-history re-sends repeatedly billing accumulated `<ultrawork-mode>` directives by
  post-processing both resident flatten/bootstrap prompts and the non-resident full-prompt path: every earlier
  complete directive becomes a one-line superseded marker while the most recent copy, surrounding text, non-text
  blocks, unmatched tags, source messages, and continuity hashes remain intact. Nested directives, including
  nesting split across serialized text blocks, fail closed unchanged instead of producing a corrupted prompt. In
  the ten-turn fixture with five 17,000-character directive bodies, serialization fell from 85,890 bytes and five
  directive blocks to 18,094 bytes and one block ([#705](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/705)).
- Fixed unchanged dynamic project rules being appended again whenever a different tool target matched the same rule:
  matching and target fingerprints remain target-specific, but delivered rule bodies now share one live-context
  deduplication scope, preventing duplicate instructions and `Project rules` activation notices until an accepted
  compaction clears the context boundary or a changed rule-content hash makes the updated body eligible for immediate
  re-injection ([#712](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/712)).
- Fixed strict OpenAI-compatible providers rejecting MCP tool definitions with HTTP 400 when a server emits the
  invalid JSON Schema form `type: null`: MCP schema conversion now recursively omits only JSON-null `type` keys at
  the root, in nested properties, and inside combiner branches before registering the shared tool definition, while
  preserving surrounding schema fields and valid null declarations such as `type: "null"` and
  `type: ["string", "null"]` ([#713](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/713)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.4] - 2026-08-04

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added one shared transcript notice system for rule-driven behavior: loop-guard, TTSR, goal continuation, and fallback handling now emit structured activation records and render them through the same notice kit, keeping transcript appearance, metadata, and activation history consistent instead of maintaining four divergent UI paths ([#689](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/689), [#692](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/692)).
- Added cross-turn repetition protection to TTSR: the agent now compares bounded normalized content across consecutive turns, detects repeated response cycles that span turn boundaries, records the triggering pattern, and interrupts the loop before another duplicate turn can continue; deterministic unit coverage and a real mock-loop QA scenario pin the behavior ([#694](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/694)).

### Changed

- Shortened the goal continuation grace countdown after an accepted user turn from 60 seconds to 10 seconds, preserving the user's opportunity to cancel automatic continuation while avoiding a full minute of idle time before a goal resumes ([#682](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/682)).

### Fixed

- Aligned the isolated local-release smoke package set with the actual Senpi release boundary: it no longer builds or packs the independently versioned SQLite storage workspace or the private server workspace, preventing unrelated upstream API drift in those packages from blocking validation of the eight packages that the local Senpi artifact actually installs.
- Pinned compiled binary release builds to Bun 1.3.14 instead of the moving canary, keeping all six cross-compilation target executables downloadable during release recovery ([#674](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/674)).
- Hid extension and runtime diagnostics emitted through Bun's native `console.info`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` while the interactive TUI owns the terminal, routing them through the existing hidden/redacted stderr sink and restoring the exact original console methods when terminal ownership ends so internal warnings no longer corrupt the transcript ([#677](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/677)).
- Recovered required compactions instead of leaving the session in a retry loop or stalled state: failed required compactions can now re-enter recovery, an accepted recovery supersedes the earlier admission error, deterministic fallback sizing is bounded, and stale terminal events remain associated with the superseded attempt rather than poisoning the active recovery ([#684](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/684)).
- Suppressed the stream error previously surfaced when a user cancels an in-progress compaction with Escape, treating the abort as an intentional terminal outcome while preserving cleanup and subsequent session usability ([#685](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/685)).
- Preserved built-in default fallback chains when users add their own configured chains instead of replacing the defaults wholesale, and identified the exact settings scope responsible when a fallback-chain warning is rendered so project, user, and runtime configuration conflicts can be diagnosed directly ([#686](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/686)).
- Restored blocked-goal continuation across interruption boundaries: sessions now prompt to resume goals that were already blocked when the process restarts, and a goal blocked by a provider error resumes on the next accepted user message instead of remaining permanently stuck ([#687](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/687), [#688](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/688)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.3-3] - 2026-08-03

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added a prompt chevron marker to the interactive composer's first editable row and preserved it across editor-padding reloads ([#666](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/666)).
- Added the official Ollama Cloud provider with `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, an `Ollama Cloud` display name, a `qwen3.5:397b` default model, and provider-owned dynamic catalog discovery preserved through `ModelRuntime`; an `ollama` entry in `models.json` with an explicit `models` catalog still takes precedence and replaces any in-memory Cloud catalog on reload ([#525](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/525) by [@thisisjun786](https://github.com/thisisjun786)).
- Added `PI_RULES_DISABLED`, `PI_RULES_MAX_RULE_CHARS`, and `PI_RULES_MAX_RESULT_CHARS` environment settings for the built-in rules extension, budgeting the complete rendered block — envelope, sentinels, headings, and separators included — against `maxResultChars` and preserving documented defaults for empty, zero, negative, fractional, or otherwise invalid values ([#670](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/670)).

### Changed

- Proportioned prompt test-discipline rules to the changed seam across dynamic-prompt verification and the GPT-5.6/Kimi-K3 presets, prohibiting prose-pinning tests ([#665](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/665)).
- Scoped `/fast` eligibility to the `openai-codex-responses` API capability instead of the built-in `openai-codex` provider id, so extension-registered Codex providers such as `codex-pool` can toggle session-level `service_tier: "priority"` without shadowing the stock command ([#656](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/656) by [@eddieparc](https://github.com/eddieparc)).
- Filtered `skill:` slash commands out of the bare `/` palette so they surface only on a matching prefix or the explicit `skill:` namespace, with a `skill:` browse hint offered while the typed prefix is still a prefix of `skill:` ([#606](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/606) by [@daniduro89](https://github.com/daniduro89)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Bun global installs and npm OIDC releases by moving the client and protocol payloads outside package-manager-owned `node_modules`, rewriting their public declaration imports to the vendored files, and pinning every internal registry dependency and Senpi peer to the exact CalVer revision ([#667](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/667), [#668](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/668), [#673](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/673)).
- Fixed Anthropic server-side model substitutions being discarded when no client fallback chain is configured; the server-fallback abort now activates only alongside a configured chain and refreshes before every prompt and after each active-model switch, while `retry.abortServerSideFallback: false` still opts out ([#671](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/671)).
- Fixed visible-cursor flicker and duplicated IME composition by keeping cursor restoration and visibility bytes inside each synchronized render frame, suppressing the editor's inverse-video fake cursor while the hardware cursor is visible, and stripping colocated fake cursors terminated by either inverse-off (`CSI 27 m`) or full reset (`CSI 0 m`) ([#571](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/571) by [@stevenahhh](https://github.com/stevenahhh)).
- Fixed `logs/session.log` compaction telemetry misattributing outcomes: lifecycle records now correlate start and terminal events through propagated request IDs, classify committed/rejected/failed/skipped/aborted/superseded dispositions, carry content-free before/after token estimates, retain superseded attempt IDs until their stale terminal arrives, and log request-less terminals such as retry exhaustion as uncorrelated no-attempt decisions instead of marking an unrelated active attempt failed ([#632](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/632) by [@madgegja](https://github.com/madgegja)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.3] - 2026-08-03

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added resume-first continuity for Claude SDK OAuth sessions, including lineage reattachment across aborts, account failover, restarts, model changes, and thinking-level changes ([#634](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/634), [#635](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/635), [#636](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/636), [#637](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/637)).
- Added hint-aware 429 retry routing with tier classification, probe-back scheduling, and visible retry-probe events in interactive and RPC modes ([#657](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/657)).
- Added retries for transient idle-compaction warm-up failures while the agent remains idle ([#661](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/661)).

### Changed

- Migrated the build toolchain to TypeScript 7.0.2 stable with native `tsc`, replacing experimental `tsgo`/`@typescript/native-preview` usage and retaining the TypeScript 6 API bridge required by the relative-import checker ([#651](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/651)).
- Moved compiled Senpi binary builds and npm publication to the Bun 1.4+ canary runtime, guarded by revision-aware assertions and cross-platform runtime smoke tests ([#651](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/651)).
- Aligned compaction and assistant-boundary restoration with Claude SDK OAuth session lineages ([#636](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/636)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude SDK OAuth abort settlement and persistence of forked session identifiers ([#634](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/634), [#637](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/637)).
- Fixed Anthropic tool-use/tool-result pairing after pruning, interruption, or model switching ([#641](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/641)).
- Compacted persisted apply-patch previews and bounded patch bodies to prevent oversized transcript artifacts ([#649](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/649)).
- Bounded summarization overflow retries to prevent unbounded compaction loops ([#652](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/652)).
- Fully reconnected expired MCP sessions instead of reusing stale transport handles ([#655](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/655)).
- Rearmed wake delivery for fresh terminal monitors ([#658](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/658)).
- Prevented loop-guard repetition detection from conflating distinct targets ([#659](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/659)).
- Unwedged goal continuations after non-automatic compaction and resumed queued messages even when compaction completion hooks throw ([#660](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/660)).

### Removed

- Removed the legacy `web-ui` workspace from the monorepo ([#651](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/651)).

## [2026.8.1] - 2026-08-01

### New Features

- Add model-optimized prompt presets for `deepseek-v4-flash`,
  `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, and `deepseek-v4-pro`. The presets use typed
  family rules over the shared dynamic prompt core to preserve harness
  authority, todo discipline, grounded missing-information handling, and the
  distinct concise-versus-deliberative reasoning behavior expected from each
  DeepSeek V4 variant
  ([#593](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/593)).

- Add DeepSeek's official API as a first-party `web_search` provider and route
  official `deepseek-v4-*` models to the native DeepSeek search tool only when
  the active model provider is actually `deepseek`. The integration uses the
  Anthropic-compatible Messages endpoint, normalizes native citations and
  results into Senpi's common search format, and prevents proxied or foreign
  models from accidentally binding the DeepSeek route
  ([#595](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/595)).

- Animate visible todo rows when they complete inside the still-active phase.
  The widget reuses the code-point-safe bounded strikethrough reveal, keeps the
  next active task highlighted, skips restored and prior-phase completions,
  and disposes its unreferenced timer after the short animation finishes
  ([#602](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/602)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

- Override the development/build-time PostCSS dependency to patched `8.5.18`,
  removing the repository's high-severity
  [GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849)
  path-traversal advisory without changing runtime package behavior or adding
  lifecycle scripts
  ([#601](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/601)).

- Reduce large-session terminal rendering work by reusing normalized line
  strings across frames and making viewport-bounded normalization and diffing
  the default. The renderer retains full fallback passes for resize and
  recovery paths, preserves image handling, bounds memoized state to the live
  transcript, and keeps output behavior unchanged while restoring cheap
  reference-equality comparisons
  ([#604](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/604)).

- Translate the remaining user-visible risky-model warning and tracked Korean
  fixtures to English while preserving wide-character, UTF-8 framing, IME,
  Markdown, and terminal-width coverage with equivalent non-Korean CJK sample
  data. No identifiers, settings keys, or runtime control flow changed
  ([#613](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/613)).

- Refresh the model inventory surfaced by `senpi --list-models` and model
  selection from the current OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Z.AI, and Z.AI
  Coding CN catalogs. The update removes retired OpenRouter batch aliases and
  three unavailable Z.AI model IDs, adds
  `thinkingmachines/inkling-small`,
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, and
  `glm-5.2-highspeed[1m]`, moves both Z.AI provider defaults and browser key
  validation to surviving `glm-5.2`, and adds a catalog-membership guard so
  external removals cannot silently strand a provider default.

### Fixed

- Treat explicit model reasoning metadata as the single source of truth for
  `xhigh` and `max` support. The model picker, favorite cycling, and provider
  request path now agree that omitted mapped levels are unsupported, `null`
  vetoes inference, and model-ID heuristics apply only when no map exists
  ([#586](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/586) by
  [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).

- Complete legacy goal-store migration without rewriting current-format goals
  or overwriting an existing destination. Legacy normalization is restricted
  to legacy reads, migration derives the correct legacy directory for session
  and no-session layouts, publication is atomic, and inert wire-compatible
  fields such as `tokenBudget` survive ordinary current-store round trips
  ([#587](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/587) by
  [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).

- Scope automatic native web-search route discovery to the active model's
  provider for every provider family, preventing unrelated models from
  inheriting routes such as `z-ai/native`. Search progress labels also stop
  exposing the internal `(max N)` planning suffix while retaining result-count
  progress and explicit user-configured routes
  ([#592](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/592)).

- Preserve the user's preferred reasoning effort across `/model`, Ctrl+P, and
  favorite-model switches. Senpi now separates the remembered global
  preference from the effective level clamped for the current model, so
  temporarily selecting a lower-capability model or a favorite override no
  longer permanently replaces a preference such as `max`
  ([#594](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/594)).

- Stabilize Codex prompt caching by applying the official stable affinity tuple
  to both SSE and WebSocket requests. Long-running sessions retain one
  `prompt_cache_key`, `session-id`, `thread-id`, and `x-client-request-id`
  identity instead of intermittently re-sending large uncached histories;
  explicit no-retention requests still disable affinity
  ([#597](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/597)).

- Measure the builtin TPS indicator with a monotonic clock rather than wall
  time. Backward system-clock adjustments can no longer produce a
  non-positive interval that silently suppresses a valid throughput
  notification, while stream-open timing and tool-wait exclusion remain
  unchanged
  ([#598](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/598)).

- Show the prominent high-reasoning warning only once per sensitive
  provider/model identity during an `AgentSession`. Cycling among `xhigh`,
  `max`, and lower efforts or switching away and back no longer re-arms the
  same warning, while selecting a different sensitive model still produces its
  own first warning
  ([#599](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/599)).

- Let Codex sessions recover from transient WebSocket fallback instead of
  remaining pinned to SSE for the rest of the process. Requests inside the
  60-second degradation window continue safely on SSE, later fresh requests
  can probe WebSocket, cleanup clears fallback state, and potentially billed
  started responses are never replayed
  ([#600](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/600)).

- Preserve rich detached `eval` peeks from the bundled codemode extension,
  including the submitted code and title, live output, phase, structured
  status events, nested tool-call summaries, elapsed duration, and structured
  displays. Terminal settlement is first-writer-wins and an explicit
  cancellation remains authoritative over a late kernel completion
  ([#603](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/603)).

- Surface failed and partially failed `apply_patch` operations as actual tool
  errors to both the model loop and interactive renderer. Complete failures no
  longer remain styled as a successful or indefinitely applying patch, while
  partial results retain successful diffs together with concrete recovery
  guidance for the failed operations
  ([#605](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/605)).

- Suppress byte-identical monitor notification batches before they wake an
  idle session. Repeated status redraws from commands such as
  `gh pr checks --watch` no longer replay the full agent context every refresh;
  genuinely changed output still resets duplicate suppression, and explicit
  `rearm` keeps its existing wake-budget semantics
  ([#612](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/612)).

- Respect an explicitly saved system `defaultModel` when the
  `recommended-models` builtin starts. Automatic recommendation switching now
  applies only to implicit `provider-default` and `first-available` fallback
  selections; models chosen through saved settings, CLI input, or scoped
  configuration are kept without a notification or persistence write that
  could overwrite the user's choice
  ([#625](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/625)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.31-2] - 2026-07-31

### New Features

- Add the builtin loop guard, which canonicalizes tool-call signatures and detects byte-identical repetitions,
  high-similarity same-tool runs, and short repeating cycles. It injects one detector-specific system reminder
  without blocking tool execution, prioritizes identical over cycle over similar matches, and resets after
  observable progress.

- Make Claude SDK OAuth a native persistent provider lane: deliver Senpi's complete composed system prompt, reuse one
  resident SDK query per session, serialize turn drains through a single consumer, fence stale generations, and
  enforce lifecycle and idle bounds while retaining the hardened fallback path.

- Show live elapsed time for active monitor watches in the terminal footer and publish monitor start metadata through
  RPC state events. Paused-state formatting, the existing width budget, and `+N more` packing remain intact.

- Make `/fast` switch ChatGPT-subscription Codex sessions to the priority service tier, and show a footer bolt for
  both session-selected priority mode and model-configured `-fast` variants.

- Expose `xhigh` and `max` in the CLI thinking-level cycle for map-less GPT-5.6 Sol models while treating explicit
  thinking maps as authoritative, so a missing mapped tier or `null` veto is never re-enabled by model-ID heuristics.

### Breaking Changes

- Rename the SDK-backed Claude subscription provider from `claude-agent-sdk` to `claude-sdk-oauth`, including its
  provider and model IDs, builtin path, settings key, account storage, TypeScript symbols, documentation, tests, and
  QA surfaces. Anthropic's upstream package name and platform sidecar names remain unchanged.

### Added

### Changed

- Deliver discovered project rules on every agent start and include the complete `## Project Instructions` region on
  the Claude SDK OAuth lane, rather than silently dropping it after the first turn or rebuilding a partial prompt
  that omits rules.

- Announce `Optimized system prompt applied: <preset>` only when a real model preset matches. Unmatched models no
  longer display a misleading `fallback (senpi-current)` preset at startup or after model selection.

- Show a truncated objective and elapsed duration in the achieved-goal footer, and let the release script skip its
  duplicate local `npm test` gate only when the exact `main` HEAD already has a successful `Check and test` CI run.
  Lookup failures, non-green checks, and `--force-tests` continue to run the local gate.

### Fixed

- Harden Claude SDK OAuth session reuse by draining each turn through the terminal SDK result, preserving final usage
  and stop metadata, scrubbing `SENPI_*` variables from child processes, bounding aborts, applying idle TTL to real
  usage, and failing closed when the resident transcript or reasoning configuration diverges.

- Prevent unavailable-tool transcript imitation by demoting historical Anthropic calls to safe records and adding a
  default TTSR detector that interrupts fabricated legacy and current unavailable-tool envelopes. `/ttsr` rule
  disablement now applies consistently, and removed debug output can no longer corrupt terminal rendering.

- Repair Anthropic `tool_use` / `tool_result` adjacency at the final provider boundary after pruning, interruption,
  or model switching. Missing results become explicit error results, while misplaced and duplicate results are
  removed before ordinary user content so Anthropic no longer rejects the request with HTTP 400.

- Route compaction summarization through the active model runtime so extension-registered providers, header-auth
  providers, and runtime-owned OpenAI remote transports compact through the same working transport as normal agent
  turns instead of failing with an unregistered-provider or missing-API-key error.

- Make required-compaction recovery durable and chronological: deterministic fallbacks retain the full suffix,
  queued input preserves global order, recovery fails closed outside required paths, and legacy budget-limited goal
  state migrates without overriding current-store data.

- Defer idle-compaction application until the next admitted prompt, enforce breaker and per-turn cap guards on
  blocking routes, admit valid prompts during breaker cooldown, and prevent queue-drain bookkeeping from leaking a
  false abort state into a later idle session.

- Pause stale goals only for accepted direct input, keep accepted-input goals active, cancel or defer monitor
  continuations safely, migrate legacy goal stores, and correlate input-disposition events so hidden stale work
  cannot resume after the user changes direction.

- Make mechanical goal blocks recoverable from both idle and queued user prompts, explain the one-message recovery
  path, count monitor-delayed continuations toward the durable cap, and clear repetition streaks whenever a turn
  uses tools or records observable progress.

- Reset exhausted classifier-refusal retry state and emit the matching retry-end event so Escape returns to normal
  behavior and double-Escape can open Session Tree after a fallback abort.

- Remove internal web-search strategy suffixes from displayed result labels.

### Removed

## [2026.7.31] - 2026-07-31

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Publish the CalVer-aware update comparison in a semver-forward bare-date release so clients still running
  `2026.7.30` can bootstrap through `senpi update`. npm semver considers same-day suffixed revisions prereleases, so
  `2026.7.30-2` contains the comparator fix but cannot be discovered by the affected old comparator; `2026.7.31`
  restores an update path that both the old semver comparator and the corrected Senpi CalVer comparator recognize as
  newer.

### Removed

## [2026.7.30-2] - 2026-07-30

### New Features

- **Safer main-model selection** — Warn interactively when a main-session provider, model id, or display name selects
  Minimax or Qwen, including startup, `/model`, exact references, favorite rotation, and post-auth defaults. The
  prominent Korean/CJK warning remains scoped to the main session; subagent routing and safe model families are
  unchanged ([#530](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/530)).
- **High-reasoning risk signal** — Emit `high_reasoning_warning` through the session API, RPC JSONL, and interactive
  red warning box when GPT-5.x `-sol` models run at `xhigh` or `max`. Detection is intentionally narrower than
  capability support, so Claude, DeepSeek, ordinary GPT, and unrelated `solar` ids do not inherit the warning.
  Events are deduplicated by provider, model, and level
  ([#517](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/517),
  [#526](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/526)).
- **Broader OMO workflow tips** — Add discoverable tips for `init-deep`, debugging, refactor,
  remove-ai-slops, and visual QA alongside the existing planning, ultrawork, research, and review guidance. The
  additions keep the existing task-extension availability gate
  ([#521](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/521)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add `packages/coding-agent/docs/release-guide.md`, the authoritative config-neutral build, plugin verification,
  local installation, Jobdori installation, troubleshooting, rollback, cleanup, and maintenance guide for
  `2026.7.30-2`.

### Changed

- Compact proactively at agent idle when the persisted context is over threshold, rather than waiting for the next
  user prompt to discover the same required compaction. The idle path reuses existing admission, lifecycle,
  cancellation, and stale-revision safeguards; below-threshold and already-running sessions remain unchanged
  ([#522](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/522)).
- Update the bundled MCP runtime dependency from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `1.29.0` to `1.30.0`. Builtin registration
  order, the `mcp`-last invariant, user MCP configuration format, and the separate hooks plugin-manifest loader are
  unchanged.
- Override the bundled `brace-expansion` runtime from `5.0.7` to patched `5.0.8`, closing
  [GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg), an unbounded expansion-length
  denial-of-service reachable transitively through `glob` and `minimatch`. This is dependency-only: glob matching,
  extension discovery, configuration formats, and command behavior are unchanged.

### Fixed

- Compare Senpi CalVer releases by the repository's `YYYY.M.D-N` contract instead of npm prerelease ordering when
  deciding whether an update is newer. The unsuffixed date is revision 1, so `2026.7.30-2` now correctly sorts after
  `2026.7.30`; clients on a same-day revision no longer accept the registry's older bare-date release as an update
  and downgrade themselves. Cross-day CalVer ordering and ordinary semver package versions retain their prior
  behavior.
- Continue a goal immediately when `create_goal` is the final tool action of the user’s turn. Freshly created goals
  are now marked goal-driven before the turn ends, so the first hidden continuation starts at once instead of being
  mistaken for a side question and waiting for the 60-second user-grace timer. User grace still applies to real
  messages sent while a goal was already active, and monitor delays, continuation caps, stale/repetition guards,
  single-flight delivery, and completion handling are unchanged.
- Reset the goal continuation progress cap after an observable tool action. Long-running goals can therefore continue
  after real progress instead of exhausting a lifetime counter and stopping despite new work, while no-progress
  repetition detection, stale-turn fencing, monitor waits, and single-flight continuation delivery remain bounded
  ([#534](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/534)).
- Restore user input that was queued while pre-prompt compaction failed, was rejected, or was aborted back into the
  interactive editor instead of allowing terminal recovery to consume or strand it. Failure metadata is scoped to
  the matching compaction attempt, terminal pre-prompt recovery is marked complete exactly once, and successful
  compaction keeps the existing queued-input admission path
  ([#535](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/535) by
  [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).
- Recover Kimi XTML response channels through the shared model-runtime boundary even when no tools are registered,
  and retry one terminal empty Kimi response once. Structural markers no longer leak into final output; successful
  recovery appears exactly once, and repeated emptiness fails visibly and finitely
  ([#523](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/523),
  [#537](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/537)).
- Reuse the active turn’s runtime API key for automatic session-title generation before resolving provider headers
  and compatibility options. A CLI `--api-key` turn and its background title request therefore use the same
  credential instead of allowing the title request to fall back to a configured key and fail with 401
  ([#519](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/519)).
- Serialize apply-patch file mutations and disclose concrete parse, seek, file-operation, and partial-success failure
  reasons. Multi-file patches no longer race concurrent writes, and callers receive the successful source-backed
  patch details together with an actionable failure instead of a generic unsuccessful result
  ([#524](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/524)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.30] - 2026-07-30

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add a rotating, content-free `logs/session.log` timeline for compaction decisions, provider failures, queued input, prompt admission failures, and clipboard errors, with secret redaction and opt-in stderr mirroring for diagnosing stuck sessions ([#512](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/512)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Keep active goals running while a live monitor, scheduled continuation, or background child can still resume them, rather than incorrectly marking monitored waits as blocked ([#515](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/515)).
- Stop Claude Agent SDK turns immediately after host-captured native or custom tools are denied, preventing duplicate provider requests and repeated denied tool calls while preserving Senpi's own permission and execution pipeline ([#511](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/511)).
- Retry shell-command credential helpers up to three times with bounded backoff before treating an API key as unavailable, avoiding provider fallback cascades from transient subprocess failures ([#490](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/490) by [@unclejobs-ai](https://github.com/unclejobs-ai)).
- Deliver input queued during failed, rejected, or aborted compaction through the native steer/follow-up queues instead of parking it indefinitely, while keeping successful compaction on the normal admission path ([#512](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/512)).
- Surface clipboard paste failures as a sanitized interactive status instead of silently swallowing permission and clipboard errors ([#512](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/512)).
- Treat `todo` remove calls with both `task` and `phase` padded as blank strings as the documented bulk-clear form, while retaining strict errors for ambiguous single-target and destructive bulk operations ([#514](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/514)).
- Move recursive Linux config watches to a shared worker thread so large directory trees no longer stall terminal input while preserving direct watchers for non-recursive targets ([#510](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/510)).
- Preserve a working Bun launcher after global self-updates by repairing the generated Node-shebang symlink with the Bun runtime that performed the update, including nonstandard Bun installation paths ([#509](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/509)).
- Route `/btw` side queries through Senpi's model runtime so providers registered dynamically with `pi.registerProvider()` work outside the built-in compatibility API registry ([#507](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/507)).
- Terminate vendored rules project-root discovery when a filesystem walk stops progressing, preventing synchronous infinite loops for Windows cross-drive and UNC paths ([#432](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/432) by [@lavi-kj](https://github.com/lavi-kj)).
- Classify Claude Code subscription-limit prose and terminal reasons as retryable rate limits so exhausted accounts enter cooldown and multi-account Claude Agent SDK sessions fail over correctly ([#505](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/505) by [@eddieparc](https://github.com/eddieparc)).
- Explain that `/fast` priority processing is unavailable on ChatGPT subscriptions and requires API-key billing, instead of misleadingly reporting the selected Codex model as unsupported ([#503](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/503) by [@eddieparc](https://github.com/eddieparc)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.29] - 2026-07-29

### New Features

- **Compaction observability and intent retention** — Stamp summaries with their route origin, log bounded structured compaction decisions with rotation and optional debug mirroring, count structurally ineffective or would-overflow attempts toward the per-turn cap, and preserve a sanitized task-intent anchor through summary generation ([#485](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/485)).
- **Native Kimi K3 tool recovery** — Understand Kimi’s XTML tool-call protocol directly and recover leaked XTML blocks in normal mode so gateway formatting defects become executable calls instead of visible channel-marker noise or dead turns ([#465](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/465)).
- **Session-scoped Codex fast mode** — Add `/fast` for OpenAI Codex sessions, switching between a model and its compatible priority-service-tier sibling without changing saved defaults or unrelated OpenAI API service-tier behavior ([#448](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/448) by [@stevenahhh](https://github.com/stevenahhh)).
- **Recommended model startup policy** — Select an authenticated recommended model when ordinary default resolution lands off-list, preserve explicit CLI/scoped selections, expose warnings and settings controls, and allow disabling the behavior with `--no-recommended-models` ([#466](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/466)).
- **Goal continuation guardrails** — Bound automatic continuation streaks, detect stale progress and no-tool stalls, suppress consumed continuation prompts from context, delay continuation after real user input, give length stops one recovery attempt, and visibly block runaway or terminally failed goals instead of silently spending unbounded turns ([#476](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/476)).
- **Goal cache-warm visibility** — Explain monitor-delayed goal continuations in the TUI, estimate retained cached tokens and cold-read savings, persist themed cache-warm transcript entries, and publish typed scheduled/resumed events for RPC and desktop clients ([#460](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/460)).
- **Immediate interactive startup feedback** — Show a delayed, phase-aware ANSI loading indicator during heavy extension/model/session bootstrap, pause it around trust prompts, and cleanly hand terminal ownership to the real TUI when startup completes ([#475](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/475)).
- **Discoverable tip catalog** — Add fork-ethos tips, place a give-me-tips pointer beneath startup and working tips, and expose the complete per-user catalog as JSON through `senpi --list-tips` ([#455](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/455), [#464](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/464)).
- **Codex usage extension example** — Add an opt-in extension that displays remaining five-hour and weekly ChatGPT Codex limits through extension footer status, using Senpi-managed OAuth, abortable single-flight polling, redirect rejection, and `/usage` lifecycle cleanup ([#469](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/469) by [@stevenahhh](https://github.com/stevenahhh)).
- **Terminal Unicode math** — Render common inline and display LaTeX as width-stable Unicode while leaving unmatched delimiters, code, and unknown commands intact ([#449](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/449) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).
- **Visible detached eval work** — Surface live detached eval cells beside monitor statuses in the interactive footer until their completion notifications arrive ([#483](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/483)).
- **Safer source-run diagnostics** — Warn when a TypeScript-from-source invocation resolves to the real `~/.senpi/agent` without an explicit isolated `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, while keeping installed and Bun-binary runs silent ([#482](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/482)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add structured compaction decision logging, route-origin and structural-yield metadata, ineffective-attempt accounting, and sanitized task-intent extraction to the builtin compaction pipeline ([#485](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/485)).
- Add `kimi-xtml` model-runtime support and Kimi-family normal-mode text-tool recovery ([#465](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/465)).
- Add `/fast`, the `recommended-models` builtin, `--no-recommended-models`, and session-scoped model/thinking setters so headless automatic choices do not overwrite global defaults ([#448](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/448) by [@stevenahhh](https://github.com/stevenahhh), [#466](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/466), [#473](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/473)).
- Add `retry.provider.streamStartTimeoutMs`, defaulting to 90 seconds and bounded by the provider idle timeout, with `0` disabling the first-event guard ([#451](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/451)).
- Add typed goal continuation scheduling/resume cache metadata, durable `goal-cache-warmup` entries, and themed transcript rendering for cache-warm events ([#460](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/460)).
- Add `senpi --list-tips`, a give-me-tips pointer under visible tips, and seven fork-ethos tips with command-aware gating ([#455](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/455), [#464](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/464)).
- Add a standalone OpenAI Codex usage extension example that publishes extension status without coupling to the built-in footer ([#469](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/469) by [@stevenahhh](https://github.com/stevenahhh)).

### Changed

- Keep the active todo frontier visible inside the fixed 10-line sidebar by anchoring long phases on current work, retaining up to two preceding tasks, filling remaining rows with upcoming work, and showing truthful earlier/later omission counts ([#450](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/450) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).
- Shorten long working-directory paths before dropping footer telemetry so context/cache/cost/model information remains visible, while preserving badges and provider/model priority at narrow widths ([#456](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/456)).
- Remove cumulative input/output token totals from the footer while retaining context-window usage, cache hit rate, cost, session, path, branch, model, and extension statuses ([#461](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/461)).
- Highlight active monitor and detached-eval footer statuses with the current theme’s selected background in interactive mode while preserving plain status strings for RPC, print, JSON, and app-server consumers ([#457](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/457), [#483](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/483)).
- Make `senpi update` compare an OMO plugin build-input fingerprint instead of rebuilding for unrelated monorepo changes, and dispatch required rebuilds to a detached worker so normal updates return after the fast fetch/compare path ([#452](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/452)).

### Fixed

- Report unregistered provider API failures with the selected provider/model and concrete configuration guidance instead of the unactionable generic `No API provider registered for api: ...` stream error.
- Treat Anthropic `credits_required` responses as permanent billing failures: skip futile same-model retries, select the billing fallback immediately, place the failed provider in the billing cooldown bucket, and pin the replacement instead of reverting into an exhausted account ([#484](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/484)).
- Escalate repeated zero-event provider stalls through progressively bounded same-model probes and the configured fallback chain instead of replaying the identical large request for the full idle timeout on every attempt ([#453](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/453)).
- Preserve steering and follow-up input across provider idle retries, cap only retry continuations at 30 seconds, restore ordinary timeout settings afterward, and retain queued input when a stalled retry terminates ([#458](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/458) by [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).
- Fail requests that receive no first provider event within the stream-start budget with a retryable, model-attributed diagnostic, aborting the dead request so retry and model fallback can proceed promptly ([#451](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/451)).
- Recognize headers-only custom providers as configured, preventing misleading “No API key found” failures when authentication is intentionally supplied through request headers ([#472](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/472) by [@eddieparc](https://github.com/eddieparc)).
- Preserve background terminal sessions, monitor subscriptions, buffered events, completion notifications, and footer watch status across `/reload`; continue to tear them down on quit, new, resume, and fork boundaries ([#463](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/463)).
- Route Python and other subprocess-kernel `agent()`, `output()`, and `tool_schema()` calls through Code Mode’s reserved bridge handler, and skip the agent event-queue wait for reentrant eval bridge calls to eliminate the Windows-amplified deadlock reported in #470/#471 ([#462](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/462), [#478](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/478)).
- Defer extension-vetoed hot reloads silently with one reason-specific notice and a bounded recheck, then perform the pending reload exactly once when the veto clears ([#474](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/474)).
- Keep recommended-model automatic switches session-scoped in print, RPC, and JSON modes so background/headless sessions cannot overwrite the user’s saved provider, model, or thinking-level defaults; interactive selections remain sticky ([#473](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/473)).
- Acquire settings locks for first-file creation, re-check the winning file under lock, and re-run merges before writing so concurrent initial settings updates cannot overwrite one another; pure missing-file reads remain side-effect free ([#481](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/481)).
- Inject a once-per-turn reminder when todo initialization/appends create open work without a live goal, distinguishing absent and completed/stale goals while leaving active, paused, and blocked goals alone ([#479](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/479)).
- Ship an availability-aware default fallback chain for Claude Fable 5 through Kimi K3, Claude Opus 5, and Claude Opus 4.8 while preserving every explicit user-authored chain, including an intentionally empty map ([#459](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/459)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.28-3] - 2026-07-28

### New Features

- **Eval tool-call widgets** — Tools invoked from eval cells render inside the eval widget with their real call shapes (bash/read/write/grep/find/ls), truthful success/error status, duration, and compact sanitized previews; edit and non-core tools show a sanitized fallback row ([#444](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/444)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add nested real-tool-shape widgets for eval sub-tool calls with bounded captured arguments (30 enriched calls per cell, 4096-character serialized args budget) ([#444](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/444)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Mark thrown tool results as errors in `executeTool` details so error-aware consumers see truthful failure status ([#444](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/444)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.28-2] - 2026-07-28

### New Features

- **Self-correcting goal continuations** — Detect goals that repeatedly wake only to wait on the same active monitors, then require an explicit process-health and blocked-state audit before another wait cycle ([#443](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/443)).
- **Clearer live monitor status** — Show monitor activity with a forward count and visible glyph so users can recognize active background subscriptions at a glance ([#441](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/441)).
- **Leaner Grok 4.5 execution prompt** — Reduce redundant CEO-core instructions while preserving the intent gate, autonomous delivery contract, verification discipline, and stop conditions ([#442](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/442)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add a goal-continuation stall check after three consecutive monitor-driven wakeups, including reset behavior for user input, monitor completion, goal replacement, and session lifecycle changes ([#443](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/443)).

### Changed

- Render the interactive monitor footer with a count-forward label and activity glyph for faster recognition in narrow and busy terminal layouts ([#441](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/441)).
- Diet the Grok 4.5 CEO prompt preset by removing duplicated instructions without weakening its outcome-first execution, manual-QA, failure-recovery, and binding stop contracts ([#442](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/442)).

### Fixed

- Preserve Anthropic conversations with compacted or otherwise missing tool-use blocks by demoting orphaned tool-result references before request submission ([#437](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/437)).
- Treat blank, whitespace-only, and null `update_goal` reasons as omitted when completing a goal, while continuing to reject non-empty completion reasons and requiring a meaningful blocked reason ([#440](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/440)).
- Execute a new eval cell when a terminal cell ID is reused and suppress unavailable timing metadata, preventing stale result replay and misleading duration output ([#439](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/439)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.28] - 2026-07-28

### New Features

- **Claude Agent SDK provider** — Sign in through native OAuth, import existing Claude credentials, pin accounts, fail over across multiple accounts with session affinity, and use in-process MCP/custom tools through the built-in provider ([#409](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/409)).
- **Self-teaching interactive UI** — Discover commands, keybindings, favorites, settings, and tool workflows through startup tips, working tips, `/help`, `/keybindings`, the shortcut overlay, and expanded feature coverage ([#405](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/405)).
- **Cache-aware long-running tools** — Foreground bash calls respect prompt-cache budgets, auto-detach at the safe deadline, and direct users to background sessions plus monitor subscriptions rather than fixed waits ([#422](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/422)).
- **Durable goal execution** — Goal completion is gated on finished todos, blocked/completed audits are decisive, todo continuity survives follow-up turns, and monitor-aware continuation avoids needless wakeups ([#427](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/427), [#428](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/428), [#430](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/430)).
- **Billing-aware model failover** — Billing and quota failures can permanently pin the configured fallback as the active session model instead of repeatedly returning to an exhausted provider ([#431](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/431), [#434](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/434)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add a built-in Claude Agent SDK provider with OAuth login/import, account listing and pinning, HRW session affinity, automatic account failover, custom-tool mapping, and in-process MCP execution ([#409](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/409)).
- Add rotating startup and working tips, `/help`, `/keybindings`, a keyboard-shortcut overlay, external-editor support, favorite-model guidance, and settings to control tip presentation ([#405](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/405)).
- Add cache-aware foreground bash timeout budgets and auto-detach behavior with completion notifications ([#422](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/422)).
- Discover project configuration from the nearest parent directory instead of requiring the working directory to be the project root ([#423](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/423)).
- Add a cancellable `session_before_reload` extension event so extensions can veto reload before session state is replaced ([#418](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/418)).
- Show active monitor count in the interactive footer and show a pirate `(🏴‍☠️ OmO Native)` badge when the native omo-senpi plus senpi-task stack is installed ([#417](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/417), [#438](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/438)).
- Add OpenAI `-fast` priority-tier model variants to the default catalog ([#420](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/420)).
- Add a Kimi K3 ambiguity preset that reflects before asking a focused clarification question ([#390](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/390)).
- Render Kitty graphics through tmux passthrough with split-safe placement ([#389](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/389) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).
- Add `tool_schema()` and self-correcting eval tool-schema feedback ([#407](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/407)).

### Changed

- Permanently switch the session model after configured billing-class fallback, including unconditional pinning for billing errors ([#431](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/431), [#434](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/434)).
- Keep emergency compaction pruning engaged with hysteresis so repeated threshold crossings do not destroy the prompt cache ([#425](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/425)).
- Bound compaction and summarization stream acquisition with wall-clock budgets, then degrade eligible transient failures without issuing a duplicate request ([#419](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/419), [#436](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/436)).
- Support OpenAI Responses remote compaction v2 and provider-native compaction capability routing ([#403](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/403)).
- Smooth streamed response pacing while keeping the final response immediate ([#396](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/396) by [@changeroa](https://github.com/changeroa)).
- Pin footer anchors, prioritize the provider prefix, restore immediate provider counts, and remove the cache-total segment so narrow layouts remain useful ([#406](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/406)).
- Lazily activate searchable MCP/eval tools only for the surface that requested them ([#408](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/408)).
- Route long waits to background sessions and monitor subscriptions, removing stale tmux and `bash_output` wait guidance ([#413](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/413), [#435](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/435)).
- Hide internal terminal wake notifications while preserving the event that resumes the agent loop ([#429](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/429)).

### Fixed

- Do not warn when optional `retry.fallbackChains` is absent; explicit malformed values still produce configuration warnings.
- Resolve provider-qualified fallback selectors within the selected provider rather than treating them as global model globs.
- Retry pre-output provider stream failures and Cloudflare 522 responses through the bounded retry/fallback policy ([#404](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/404), [#421](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/421)).
- Omit unsupported Codex reasoning-summary payloads and preserve session affinity through every compaction and summarization path ([#412](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/412) by [@DevNewbie1826](https://github.com/DevNewbie1826), [#416](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/416)).
- Avoid unsupported minimal reasoning during compaction ([#398](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/398)).
- Degrade transient blocking-compaction failures cleanly instead of aborting the active session ([#391](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/391)).
- Keep the startup tip visible when extensions install a custom header ([#410](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/410)).
- Initialize themes before starting the multi-session RPC host ([#414](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/414)).
- Stop config reload loops caused by the global default extension shim, watch only loadable extension entries, and ignore unrelated runtime-state subtrees ([#397](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/397), [#400](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/400)).
- Prevent zombie processes from being counted as live during process-tree teardown verification ([#402](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/402)).
- Keep monitor tools available with native bash and flatten the monitor schema so Anthropic payloads retain every field ([#393](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/393), [#401](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/401)).
- Retry transient session-title generation failures and sanitize runtime-error presentation ([#394](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/394)).
- Stop reload from auto-starting a stopped agent and block an active goal when the user aborts outside an agent run ([#395](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/395)).
- Preserve todo continuity, enforce open-todo completion gates, and clean up monitor-aware goal continuation after reload ([#427](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/427), [#428](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/428), [#430](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/430)).
- Preserve paste-marker expansion across editor transfers and prevent repeated render loops in large sessions ([#411](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/411) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter), [#424](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/424) by [@sigridjineth](https://github.com/sigridjineth)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.26] - 2026-07-26

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

- Make `bash_output` a non-blocking snapshot operation; use background monitor subscriptions and completion notifications for event-driven waits.
- Remove the separate GPT-only Code Mode `exec`/`wait` tools in favor of persistent `eval` tool composition.

### Added

- Add env-gated `--grok-neo` interactive chrome with `grok-night` and `grok-day` themes while keeping the classic TUI as the default.
- Compose up to five leading `/skill:` commands across prompt, steer, follow-up, and autocomplete paths, and add `/exit` as an alias for `/quit`.
- Add the background `monitor` tool, coalesced line-event notifications, and exit-code/output-tail completion messages for long-running terminal sessions.
- Auto-correct supported malformed todo calls, conservatively resolve fuzzy task names, and render every optional todo operation exhaustively.
- Project extension-injected app-server messages as tracked turns and emit `session_extensions_removed` when reloads or session replacement remove extensions.
- Add durable blocked-goal persistence and resume handling, including explicit user-abort lifecycle data.
- Add opt-in Inspector VM-import recovery and transfer fixed Inspector endpoints from the launcher to the interactive child ([#336](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/336) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).

### Changed

- Retry transient failures on the same model before entering fallback chains, cap server-requested waits, and use shorter cooldowns for transport failures; Codex upstream websocket failures now participate in the retry path ([#330](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/330) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).
- Keep unchanged classic MCP servers alive across `/reload`, report reload timing phases, and eliminate redundant settings/model scans.
- Bound inline provider image history, preserve compaction ownership across preflight/abort races, and pin cheap compaction warmups to the active model ([#341](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/341) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).
- Speed up compaction across model switches and harden cross-provider replay ([#380](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/380) by [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).
- Bound compaction status rows to the terminal width while retaining cancellation guidance ([#328](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/328) by [@minpeter](https://github.com/minpeter)).

### Fixed

- Retain extension-injected user messages when prompt admission rejects, and stop stale extension-context error spray after session replacement.
- Prevent classifier-refused partial tool calls from executing and route Anthropic policy blocks through the pinned refusal fallback.
- Preserve OpenAI freeform tool replay, repair Anthropic server-tool histories, and avoid cross-provider reasoning/tool-ID corruption ([#256](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/256) by [@ThewindMom](https://github.com/ThewindMom)).
- Ship the native sidecars and bundled dependency aliases that the compiled and npm-installed CLI probes at runtime.
- Stabilize alternate-chrome tool rendering, slash-menu colors, CJK/select-list layout, and compaction labels across narrow terminals.

### Removed

- Remove the legacy out-of-process `--neo` Go TUI/daemon surface and the `/sessions` observer HUD.
## [2026.7.25-2] - 2026-07-25

### New Features

- **Claude Opus 5** — Available on Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock with adaptive thinking (including `xhigh`), inference profiles, and prompt caching. See [Providers](docs/providers.md#api-keys).
- **Anthropic gateway bearer auth** — `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` authenticates against Anthropic-compatible gateways that require `Authorization: Bearer`, including compaction and branch summaries. See [Environment Variables or Auth File](docs/providers.md#environment-variables-or-auth-file).
- **Faster, more resilient model catalogs** — pi.dev catalogs revalidate with `If-None-Match` so unchanged providers answer with an empty `304`, and llama.cpp models stay listed across restarts. See [llama.cpp](docs/llama-cpp.md).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Exposed the `outputPad` setting to custom message renderers. See [Extensions](docs/extensions.md) ([#7045](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7045) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Added inherited `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` bearer authentication for Anthropic-compatible gateways. See [Providers](docs/providers.md#environment-variables-or-auth-file) ([#5871](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5871)).

### Changed

- Changed pi.dev model catalog refreshes to revalidate with `If-None-Match`, so unchanged provider catalogs answer with an empty `304` instead of a full download.
- Changed inherited Radius OAuth device authorization, token exchange, and refresh requests to use the configured gateway directly.
- Changed inherited model loading errors to append the underlying cause, so auth failures such as `OAuth refresh failed for openai-codex` report the provider response instead of a bare wrapper message.

### Fixed

- Fixed startup context file discovery to skip directories that match context file names such as `AGENTS.md`, which produced `EISDIR` warnings ([#7106](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7106) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia)).
- Fixed the llama.cpp extension to persist its model catalog, so llama.cpp models stay listed before the first successful refresh. See [llama.cpp](docs/llama-cpp.md) ([#7072](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7072) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

- Exposed `PI_SESSION_ID`, `PI_SESSION_FILE`, `PI_PROVIDER`, `PI_MODEL`, and `PI_REASONING_LEVEL` to commands run by built-in and factory-created bash tools. See [Bash Tool Session Environment](docs/environment-variables.md#bash-tool-session-environment).
- Added streaming `bash_execution_update` events for direct RPC bash commands, correlated with request IDs. See [RPC bash events](docs/rpc.md#bash_execution_update) ([#6971](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6971) by [@ananthakumaran](https://github.com/ananthakumaran)).

- Fixed TUI debug and crash logs to respect custom agent directories instead of always writing under `~/.pi/agent` ([#6958](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6958) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed slow Ctrl+G external-editor startup when the system temporary directory contains many entries ([#6903](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6903) by [@christianklotz](https://github.com/christianklotz)).
- Fixed startup resource display to preserve relative paths for sibling npm extensions loaded by a package ([#6964](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6964) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed compaction and branch-summary requests to use fresh routing session IDs with prompt caching disabled where supported ([#6618](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6618) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier)).
- Fixed explicit self-updates when `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` is set ([#6977](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6977)).
- Fixed scoped model IDs containing brackets to resolve as literal exact matches before glob matching ([#6210](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6210)).
- Fixed inherited OpenAI and Anthropic provider retry waits to honor abort signals and configured delay limits ([#6980](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6980) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).
- Fixed fresh installs from preferring bundled model catalogs over newer remote catalogs because package file mtimes were newer ([#7016](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7016) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed inherited editor scroll indicators overflowing narrow terminals ([#7015](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7015) by [@christianklotz](https://github.com/christianklotz)).
- Fixed llama.cpp models to use the loaded context window as their output token limit instead of capping it at 16K ([#7034](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7034) by [@christianklotz](https://github.com/christianklotz)).
- Fixed release source archives to include the generated provider model data used to build standalone binaries.
- Updated the packaged `protobufjs` dependency to 7.6.5 to address GHSA-j3f2-48v5-ccww ([#7005](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7005)).

- Fixed `/model` to reload updated `models.json` configuration when opening the model picker ([#6999](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6999)).

## [0.81.1] - 2026-07-21

### New Features

- **Verifiable release source archives** — GitHub releases now include deterministic, checksummed source archives with instructions for rebuilding standalone binaries. See [Building standalone binaries from release source](../../README.md#building-standalone-binaries-from-release-source).
- **Resilient compaction and branch summaries** — Transient provider failures now follow the configured retry policy, with retry lifecycle events available to interactive, JSON, RPC, and SDK consumers.

- Fixed interactive startup waiting for background model catalog refresh while computing the footer provider count.
- Restored the default stream fallback for extensions using the pre-0.81 agent-core API ([#6915](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6915)).
- Fixed inherited Kimi K3 models from Moonshot AI and Moonshot AI China to use the OpenAI thinking format and expose reasoning effort support.

## [0.81.0] - 2026-07-21

### New Features

- **Local llama.cpp model management** — Connect to a llama.cpp router, search and download Hugging Face models, and explicitly load or unload models with live progress. See [llama.cpp](docs/llama-cpp.md).
- **Full provider extensions** — Extensions can register complete pi-ai providers with authentication, model refresh, filtering, and custom streaming. See [Register New Provider](docs/custom-provider.md#register-new-provider).
- **Qwen Token Plan providers** — Use the built-in international and China subscription providers with regional endpoints and API-key authentication. See [API Keys](docs/providers.md#api-keys).

## [2026.7.23] - 2026-07-23

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added OpenAI Codex remote compaction with provider capability gating and safe preservation of the in-flight prompt during replay ([#304](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/304)).
- Added GPT Code Mode and eval routing, including `exec` and `wait` support for compatible GPT models ([#301](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/301)).
- Added per-section thinking-duration headers in interactive output.

### Changed

- Updated the vendored Codex app-server protocol types to Codex commit `9fc715c0861c956c894a91890b78dc05b304ba29`.

### Fixed

- Fixed interactive tool-progress durations to use the shared OpenCode-parity formatter.

### Removed

## [2026.7.22-2] - 2026-07-22

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Documented the Codex HEAD app-server parity surface, protocol provenance, intentional `-32601` boundaries, and the source-oracle differential QA harness. The documentation now calls out deliberate behavior differences, including post-restart history reconstruction, aggregated turn diffs, partial thread settings, and honest account reads.

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.7.22] - 2026-07-22

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added configurable Claude text tool-call recovery across both `ModelRuntime` streaming entry points, `models.json` definitions/overrides, persisted sessions, and isolated Anthropic/OpenAI mock-loop QA.
- Added the `look_at` vision-delegation tool with model capability gating and configurable settings/context support.
- Added hot reload for configuration resources, including a documented extension protocol, change events, hash-based self-write suppression, and safe lifecycle/mode handling.
- Added `/btw` for parallel side questions, progressive web-fetch feedback, and incremental terminal rendering for tool activity and results.
- Added Alibaba Cloud Model Studio Token Plan provider setup and model support.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed the interactive render hot path re-materializing the entire session every frame: `SessionManager.getEntries()`, no-arg `getBranch()`, and `getSessionName()` are now memoized behind a monotonic mutation counter, eliminating repeated deep copies of large sessions at frame rate.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay to omit invalid custom tool-call item IDs.
- Fixed compaction budgeting and diagnostics, including bounded summary streams and preservation of queued input after failures.
- Fixed MCP lazy-start races so registered tools and instructions reliably rehydrate.
- Fixed queued steering/follow-up delivery and tool-result reveal behavior across session rebinds.

### Removed

## [2026.7.20-2] - 2026-07-20

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added configurable per-model retry fallback chains and the `/fallback` command, including scoped cooldowns, automatic primary-model reversion, model-fallback events in RPC/app-server consumers, and interactive fallback status.
- Added progress updates that identify the active web-search provider for each attempt.

### Changed

- Abbreviated interactive footer token counts using K/M/B notation.

### Fixed

- Fixed goal token accounting during active turns so `get_goal`, updates, completion, and shutdown checkpoints include streamed usage without double counting or charging usage before a goal was created.
- Fixed compaction recovery to preserve queued input and transforms, reject unsafe or oversize compactions visibly, and avoid stale compaction barriers.
- Fixed coding-agent model fallback behavior for classifier refusals, hard failures, invalid chains, and self-referential candidates.

### Removed

## [2026.7.20] - 2026-07-20

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the snapshot-style `todowrite`/`todoread` pair with one phased, op-based `todo` tool; the `todowrite` builtin extension id remains for loader compatibility.

### Added

- Added a `/todo` command for user-side todo management: view, overlay `edit` (Markdown checklist), `copy`, `export`/`import` (default `TODO.md`), and fuzzy-matched `append`/`start`/`done`/`drop`/`rm`; user edits persist as `senpi.todo-state` entries and notify the agent next turn.
- Added `antml` as a valid `compat.toolCallFormat` in custom `models.json` provider and model definitions: ANTML `<function_calls>`/`<invoke>` text-tool protocol with Claude-Code-style failure tolerance.

### Removed

## [2026.7.17-2] - 2026-07-17

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added a `<workstation>` block (OS/kernel, arch, CPU, GPU, terminal) to the dynamic system prompt, followed by a dialect-tuned execution-context instruction telling the model that `bash`/`eval` run on this workstation while written code may target other machines. Presets pass their model-family dialect (Claude/GLM, GPT, Kimi); the fallback prompt uses a maximum-emphasis default.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi K3 prompt preset tuning to discourage overthinking and keep concise tool use ([#225](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/225)).
- Fixed Moonshot-flavored OpenAI backends by normalizing tool parameters through a dedicated compatibility layer so function schemas and result images are accepted by Moonshot's API ([#225](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/225)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.17] - 2026-07-17

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added a Kimi K3 prompt preset for catalog models using `kimi-k3` or the Kimi Coding `k3` id ([#220](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/220)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed interactive tool renderers to receive result-presence context, allowing self-framed tools to replace their pending view instead of stacking duplicate output ([#223](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/223)).
- Fixed the active goal footer to update elapsed time live while preserving accounting parity and stopping the ticker outside active TUI goals ([#221](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/221)).
- Fixed builtin webfetch output to cap model-facing content at 50 KB, preserve a UTF-8-safe leading prefix, and report truncation metadata instead of forcing compaction with oversized responses ([#222](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/222)).
- Fixed Anthropic native web search gating and replay sanitization for compatible endpoints while preserving the function-tool fallback and allowing explicit `compat.supportsWebSearch` model configuration ([#213](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/213) by [@tmdgusya](https://github.com/tmdgusya)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.16-3] - 2026-07-16

### Removed

## [2026.7.16] - 2026-07-16

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `AuthStorage.list()` from a synchronous provider-ID list to asynchronous non-secret credential metadata matching the pi-ai `CredentialStore` contract.

### Added

- Added inherited Kimi K3 model availability and deferred tool loading for compatible providers.
- Added `ModelRuntime` as the canonical async SDK and internal model/auth facade while retaining the fork's `AuthStorage`, `ModelRegistry`, and corresponding `CreateAgentSessionOptions` compatibility APIs.

### Changed

- Tuned the `gpt-5.6` system prompt preset against the oh-my-opencode Hephaestus GPT-5.6 prompts: verification wording now names validators senpi can actually run (type check/lint instead of a nonexistent diagnostics tool), parallel tool calls are the stated default with serial as the exception and no `;`/`&&` chaining of unrelated shell steps, todo items are named by deliverable and reconciled at turn end, and bracketed `【F:...】`-style citations are banned from output.
- Reframed the skill-loading trigger in every system prompt to load skills on loose description match, stating the cost asymmetry (an irrelevant load costs little; a missed relevant skill degrades the work).
- Added an instruction-file precedence rule to the dynamic system prompt's Project Context section: instruction files bind files under their directory, deeper files win on conflict, and explicit user instructions override.

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic compaction to preserve user, OMO steer, and goal follow-up messages appended while compacted context is rebuilt.
- Fixed SDK-created sessions to inherit the configured agent stream idle timeout.
- Fixed inherited Cloudflare endpoint placeholder resolution and lazy provider final-message forwarding.
- Fixed cloning or forking a session before its first assistant response to explain that the session must be saved first.

### Removed

## [0.80.9] - 2026-07-16

### New Features

- **Kimi K3 and deferred tool loading** — Use Kimi K3 across built-in providers, including progressive extension tool activation through Kimi’s native protocol. See [Dynamic Tool Loading](docs/extensions.md#dynamic-tool-loading), [OpenAI Compatibility](docs/models.md#openai-compatibility), and the [`kimi-deferred-tools.ts`](examples/extensions/kimi-deferred-tools.ts) example.

### Added

- Added inherited Kimi K3 support for Kimi Coding, Moonshot AI, Moonshot AI China, OpenRouter, and Vercel AI Gateway.
- Added Kimi deferred tool loading for extension-driven tool activation. See [Dynamic Tool Loading](docs/extensions.md#dynamic-tool-loading), [OpenAI Compatibility](docs/models.md#openai-compatibility), and the [`kimi-deferred-tools.ts`](examples/extensions/kimi-deferred-tools.ts) example.

### Changed

- Changed xAI login to use a prefilled device-authorization link labeled “Sign in with SuperGrok or X Premium,” and changed the default xAI model to Grok 4.5 ([#6734](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6734) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited Kimi K3 output limits for Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter models.
- Fixed cloning or forking a session before its first assistant response to explain that the session must be saved first.

### Removed

- Removed Grok 3, Grok 3 Fast, Grok 4.20 variants, and Grok Code Fast 1 from the built-in xAI model catalog ([#6734](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6734) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

## [0.80.8] - 2026-07-16

### New Features

- **Unified model runtime and provider authentication** — `ModelRuntime` centralizes model configuration, provider-owned `/login`, and dynamic provider catalogs. See [Providers](docs/providers.md).
- **Live model catalog refresh** — `/model` refreshes configured providers in the background, and `pi update --models` forces an immediate refresh. See [Install and Manage](docs/packages.md#install-and-manage).
- **xAI device-code OAuth and Grok 4.5 Responses support** — Sign in to xAI with a device code and use Grok 4.5 with low, medium, or high thinking. See [xAI](docs/providers.md#xai-grokx-subscription).

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the SDK's `CreateAgentSessionOptions.authStorage` and `modelRegistry` options with the async `modelRuntime` option. `AuthStorage` and its storage backends are no longer exported; use `ModelRuntime` (or a custom pi-ai `CredentialStore`), or `readStoredCredential()` for one-off reads of auth.json.
- Removed redundant `ModelRuntime.getAll()`, `find()`, `getSnapshot()`, and `getAuthOptions()` projections. Use the pi-ai `Models` methods `getModels()`, `getModel()`, `getProviders()`, and `checkAuth()` directly.
- Replaced SDK request-auth assembly through `ModelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders()` with `ModelRuntime.getAuth()`. Passing a provider ID returns provider-scoped auth; passing a model also resolves built-in, `models.json`, and extension model headers.
- Changed extension-facing `ModelRegistry.refresh()` from synchronous `void` to `Promise<void>` because `models.json` loading is asynchronous. Extensions must await it before making synchronous registry reads.
- Moved canonical dynamic catalog refresh to async `ModelRuntime.refresh()`/pi-ai `Models.refresh()`. Legacy extension OAuth `modifyModels` remains supported as a synchronous compatibility projection after credential initialization.

### Added

- Added `ModelRuntime` as the canonical async SDK and internal model/auth facade while preserving the synchronous extension-facing `ModelRegistry` API. `ModelRuntime.create()` accepts any pi-ai `CredentialStore` through its `credentials` option.
- Added provider-owned `/login` discovery directly from registered pi-ai providers, including ambient auth status and informational links.
- Added file-backed dynamic catalogs in `models-store.json`, per-provider pi.dev catalog overlays, and Radius gateway support including offline migration from legacy credential-cached catalogs.
- Added extension provider `refreshModels(context)` support for dynamic model discovery with optional provider-controlled persistence.
- Added `pi update --models` to force an immediate model catalog refresh without updating pi or extensions.
- Added inherited xAI device-code OAuth login and Grok 4.5 OpenAI Responses support, with low, medium, and high thinking levels ([#6651](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6651) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

### Changed

- Changed `ModelRuntime` to compose built-in providers, immutable `models.json` configuration, and extension overlays through ad-hoc pi-ai provider methods.
- Changed `ModelRuntime` to own final request assembly: `getAuth(model)` includes configured model headers, stream methods resolve auth once, and `before_provider_headers` runs as the Models-only header transform before provider dispatch.
- Changed `/model` to render the current model snapshot immediately, refresh configured providers in the background, and update the open selector with partial results or timeout errors.

### Fixed

- Fixed configured-provider catalog refresh to parse pi.dev's model-ID keyed responses, throttle checks to once per four hours, send the versioned pi user agent, treat unimplemented routes as unavailable overlays, and show concise refresh status in `/model`.
- Fixed adjacent assistant thinking blocks to render as one thinking section.
- Fixed inherited OpenAI Codex session IDs longer than 64 characters to meet the API limit ([#6630](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/6630)).
- Fixed inherited terminal output to normalize tab characters consistently ([#6697](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6697) by [@xz-dev](https://github.com/xz-dev)).
- Fixed the Windows terminal title after checking npm packages ([#6629](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/6629)).
- Fixed Bun standalone binaries to bundle OAuth adapters for interactive logins.

## [2026.7.14-3] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added Radius gateway support for custom `models.json` providers, including Radius OAuth login and dynamic model discovery.
- Added inherited forced tool-call support for OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex models ([#6588](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6588)).

### Changed

- Stopped including the current date in the system prompt so prompts no longer bake in stale date context ([#6621](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6621)).
- Stopped sending OpenAI Responses session-id fields to OpenCode models that opt out of session IDs ([#6645](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6645) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Fixed

- Clarified the interactive `/login` option labels.
- Fixed `senpi uninstall` under npm to pass `--legacy-peer-deps`, avoiding uninstall failures from unrelated peer dependency conflicts ([#6604](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6604) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed branch summaries when the selected model uses ambient auth instead of a literal API key ([#6595](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6595) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed inherited Anthropic empty-usage handling, OpenAI/Azure Responses encrypted reasoning replay, Bedrock stop-reason errors, OpenRouter and Responses WebSocket session affinity, and GitHub Copilot MAI-Code routing from the upstream AI package.

### Removed

## [2026.7.14-2] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added `anthropic-xml` as a valid `compat.toolCallFormat` in custom `models.json` provider and model definitions.

### Changed

- Hardened the GPT-5.6 prompt preset's stop contract to Hephaestus parity: the intent line now declares a binding per-turn stop condition, and the Stop Rules section became a Stop Goal that makes stopping mandatory and immediate once every done-condition holds.

### Fixed

- Preserved Anthropic server-side web search `encrypted_content` during same-model replay so follow-up turns no longer fail after native web searches ([#208](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/208)).
- Preserved final output from fast-exiting persistent-terminal commands by draining native PTY readers before exit and subscribing before session startup ([#207](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/207)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.14] - 2026-07-14

### Added

### Changed

- Improved the bundled `eval` tool instructions and examples to teach persistent-state reuse, batch file processing, and parallel session-tool fan-out within a single cell.

### Fixed

- Fixed built-in web search discovery so model aliases sharing a provider endpoint no longer multiply serial fallback attempts, aborting a search stops pending native authentication discovery, and dotted private host spellings are rejected before auth or fetch ([upstream #5](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/pi-websearch/pull/5), [upstream #6](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/pi-websearch/pull/6)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.13] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added a bundled persistent-kernel `eval` extension for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Julia, with persistent state, `agent()` and `output()` bridges, structured status streaming, bounded spillable output, rich terminal rendering, completion schemas, and cancellation-safe cleanup.

### Changed

- Reworked the GPT-5.6 prompt preset into a Hephaestus-parity autonomous deep worker with explicit manual QA, failure recovery, shared-worktree safeguards, and outcome-based stop rules.

### Fixed

- Fixed post-compaction queued input and tool continuations so they no longer deadlock, lose ownership, or surface stale continuation failures while the TUI and neo resume work.
- Fixed project-trust reloads dropping builtin and bundled extensions, including the bundled `eval` extension.

### Removed

## [2026.7.11] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added cache-friendly dynamic tool loading for extension tools activated by tool results. Supported Anthropic and OpenAI Responses models load definitions where they become available, preserving the cached prompt prefix. See [Dynamic Tool Loading](docs/extensions.md#dynamic-tool-loading) ([#6474](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6474)).
- Added inherited native `xhigh` and `max` thinking levels for Claude Fable 5 across all generated provider catalogs ([#6490](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6490) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Added `Ctrl+X` to copy the last assistant message, or the selected message in `/tree`.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited OpenRouter model context windows to use the top provider's actual context length ([#6481](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6481) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed `Ctrl+V` to paste clipboard text when the pasteboard does not contain an image.
- Fixed `/login amazon-bedrock` to prompt for and save a Bedrock API key instead of only displaying ambient AWS credential setup instructions.

### Removed

## [0.80.6] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added a `gpt-5.6` system prompt preset covering the whole GPT-5.6 series (`gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`), tuned per the GPT-5.6 prompting guide: a shorter outcome-first full-core rewrite with prioritization-based style, a compact authorization policy, and tool-loop stopping conditions.

### Changed

- Exposed the active terminal image protocol to extension tool renderers so custom renderers can avoid duplicate image fallbacks.

### Fixed

- Prevented untrusted image MIME labels from injecting terminal control sequences through custom renderer fallbacks.
- Fixed goal persistence to use atomic file replacement and narrowly recover the observed stale closing-brace
  corruption, preventing session resume crashes without accepting other malformed JSON.

- Fixed `bash_output` waits ignoring turn cancellation and accepting unbounded model-supplied timeouts; waits now release without killing the background terminal and individual polls are capped at five minutes.
- Fixed `bash_output` waiting on `wait_for` even when the pattern had already arrived in unread output before the waiter was registered.
- Fixed emergency context pruning to reserve a model-aware output allowance without collapsing the usable prompt budget, preventing oversized tool results from exceeding new-model input limits.
- Fixed invalid extension tool renderers displaying `[render error: Box]` instead of fallback rendering.

### Removed

## [2026.7.10-2] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added the opt-in `max` thinking level across CLI, SDK, RPC, model selection, settings, and themes.
- Added request-wide input-token pricing tiers to custom model costs in `models.json`, `modelOverrides`, and extension-registered providers.
- Added `~` expansion for the `shellPath` setting ([#6470](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6470) by [@aaronkyriesenbach](https://github.com/aaronkyriesenbach)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited post-compaction output-token budgeting to ignore stale assistant usage from before the compaction boundary.
- Fixed inherited GPT-5.4, GPT-5.5, and GPT-5.6 long-context pricing metadata, while excluding the nonexistent bare `gpt-5.6` OpenAI/Azure alias.
- Fixed inherited Anthropic message conversion to preserve thinking blocks with empty thinking text but a valid signature instead of dropping them ([#6457](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6457) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed inherited Anthropic replay to send the normalized thinking signature value after signature narrowing.
- Fixed inherited OpenAI-compatible simple streams to preserve provider-specific `max` reasoning mappings instead of clamping them.
- Fixed inherited same-model signed thinking replay to keep non-empty signed blocks only when provider state must be replayed, while preserving empty opaque signed blocks.

### Removed

## [2026.7.10] - 2026-07-10

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed `npm install @code-yeongyu/senpi` shipping a broken dependency tree: the published tarball no longer includes `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, which (combined with `bundleDependencies`) made npm treat the bundled subtree as the complete locked tree and skip installing non-bundled direct deps like `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `cross-spawn`, crashing the CLI at startup with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The publish/bundle staging manifest is now generated as `publish-deps.lock.json` (never packed), and a pack guard prevents any future `npm-shrinkwrap.json` from being shipped.

### Removed

## [2026.7.9-2] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added prompt cache miss tracking and optional TUI notices.
- Added the `agent_settled` lifecycle event for extensions and RPC clients.
- Added provider arguments for `/login`.
- Added a `before_provider_headers` extension hook.
- Added named inline extension factories for SDK users.
- Exposed GPT-5.6 model metadata through the CLI model registry.

### Changed

- Improved project-local `config` resource management.
- Aligned reload command descriptions across docs, examples, and slash commands.
- Updated model catalogs, including GitHub Copilot extended-context windows and Xiaomi token-plan catalogs.
- Warned when `--session-id` creates a new session.
- Tool-result truncation markers now include retrieval guidance (re-run with a narrower range); legacy markers remain parseable.

### Fixed

- Counted context-visible custom messages in compaction budgeting.
- Avoided Windows context-file discovery hangs.
- Applied `modelOverrides` to extension-provided models.
- Fixed upstream-merge regressions that could run queued follow-up or goal-continuation prompts after aborted turns, drop context-exclusion filtering during compaction, or show stale MCP diagnostics.
- Restored exact comma-formatted token counts in the interactive footer.
- Fixed native clipboard image handling in Bun releases.
- Prevented double-selecting a fork menu entry.
- Cleared label timestamp cache state when starting new sessions.
- Normalized null message content at ingestion boundaries.
- Retried Bun socket-drop provider failures and `ResourceExhausted` errors.
- Used a `(no tool output)` placeholder for empty text-only tool results.
- Failed tool calls from length-truncated assistant messages.
- Kept TUI paste tracking correct when paste markers are deleted or the terminal is cleared.
- Tool results are no longer head/tail-truncated below the emergency context threshold; the model now sees full tool output until context genuinely runs out (session 019f45c0 regression).

### Removed

## [2026.7.9] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added MCP skills-carry support: a skill can ship MCP servers via an `mcp.json` sidecar or SKILL.md `mcp:` frontmatter; their tools stay hidden (zero payload cost) until the skill loads.
- Added the opt-in MCP proxy exposure tier (`exposure:"proxy"`): one `mcp_<server>` gateway tool with search/describe/call ops.
- Added MCP resources: `mcp_list_resources`/`mcp_read_resource` utility tools, `@mcp:<server>/<uri>` prompt mentions, and resource-update subscriptions.
- Added MCP prompts as slash commands (`/mcp:<server>:<prompt>`) with argument collection and editor injection.
- Added MCP elicitation (form mode) with sequential input dialogs, clean declines in non-interactive runs, and a bounded cancel timeout.
- Added MCP server log routing (RFC-5424 levels onto the per-server logger, `logLevel` filtering, burst capping) and user documentation at `docs/mcp.md`.

- Added automatic title generation for unnamed sessions from the first meaningful user prompt, using the active model in a cached forked request.
- Added the `pi.executeTool()` extension API so extension code can run active tools through the normal validation, permission, `tool_call`, and `tool_result` pipeline.

- Added `senpi app-server` mode for Codex-compatible app-server integrations, including stdio, websocket, and websocket-over-UDS transports, multi-session serving, wire approval requests, daemon subcommands, and protocol documentation.
- Added built-in MCP support as a builtin extension: `mcpServers` config (global, project, and imported Claude
  Desktop configs) with TypeBox validation and env interpolation, `stdio` and streamable `http` transports, bearer
  and OAuth (code / client-credentials) auth, server lifecycles (`lazy` / `eager` / `keep-alive`) with idle shutdown,
  spec-correct tool registration with exposure policies (`auto` / `direct` / `search` / `proxy`) and
  include/exclude filtering, server instructions injection into the system prompt, secret-redacting per-server logs,
  and the `/mcp` command suite (`status`, `add`, `enable`/`disable`, `test`, `logs`, `reconnect`). Uses the
  exact-pinned official MCP SDK.
- Added auth RPC commands for external UIs: `get_auth_providers`, `login_start`, `login_cancel`, `login_api_key`,
  and `logout`, with OAuth completion delivered via `auth_login_url` / `auth_login_end` session events.
- Added the neo TUI launch handoff (`--neo`, `--neo-isolated`, `--neo-bin`) and the shared neo daemon
  (`--listen <socket>`: supervisor with atomic registry, token+version handshake, per-connection worker processes,
  and idle shutdown via `neoDaemon.idleShutdownMs`). Gated OFF by default behind `SENPI_ENABLE_NEO=1`: until the
  per-platform neo binary packages ship, the flags are absent from `--help` and parse as unknown flags so a released
  build never exposes a non-functional `--neo`. The Go daemon supervisor forces the gate on for its own child.
- Added a convention guard that rejects senpi-defined PascalCase tool names in core and builtin extension tool registrations.
- Added the persistent-terminal tool suite (built-in `terminal` extension): the `bash` tool is now PTY-backed with `run_in_background`, `cols`, and `rows`, plus companion tools `bash_output` (with `wait_for`/`filter`/`view:"screen"`), `bash_input` (stdin + named keys), `bash_resize`, and `kill_bash`. Backed by `@earendil-works/pi-pty` (native ConPTY on Windows, `child_process` pipe fallback otherwise). Adds `SENPI_GIT_BASH_PATH` + shell-kind resolution (cmd `/c`, PowerShell `-NoProfile -Command`), `terminal.*` settings, idle-guarded async completion wake, and permission-gates `bash_input` in the `bash` class. See `docs/terminal-tools.md`.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed the compiled Bun single-file binary crashing on every command (`Cannot find module '../package.json'`): the bundled `@earendil-works/pi-pty` loader read its version eagerly via `require("../package.json")`, which does not exist in the embedded Bun filesystem. It now falls back to the `package.json` shipped beside the executable (lockstep-versioned), so the Bun binary starts.
- Fixed the native `@earendil-works/pi-pty` prebuild sentinel being coupled to the CalVer package version, which made every release invalidate the vendored prebuilds (the publish gate failed with a `__senpiPtyV<version>` sentinel mismatch). The sentinel is now a stable native-ABI tag (`__senpiPtyAbi1`) that only changes on a backward-incompatible native change, so CalVer releases no longer require rebuilding or re-vendoring the prebuilt binaries.
- Fixed context-overflow recovery for configured upstream model aliases, so a selected alias such as `gpt-5.5-fast` can auto-compact and retry when the provider reports the wire model `gpt-5.5`.
- Fixed the built-in `todowrite` tool call row to show the actual todo items instead of only an item count.
- Fixed sessions going stale forever when the network dropped and reconnected mid-stream: the agent loop's provider stream idle timeout is now enabled by default (follows `httpIdleTimeoutMs`, default 5 min, `0` disables; `retry.provider.timeoutMs` overrides), so a silently dead connection fails with a retryable idle-timeout error and auto-retry recovers the turn. Previously the guard was off unless `retry.provider.timeoutMs` was set, which left the Bun binary (no undici dispatcher protection) hanging indefinitely.

### Removed

- Removed the never-functional `pi-codex-app-server` extension and flags; earlier Unreleased entries described unwired scaffolding rather than a usable integration surface.

## [2026.7.5-2] - 2026-07-05

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.7.5] - 2026-07-05

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.7.4] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added `ctx.updateToolHookStatus()` so `tool_call`/`tool_result` extension handlers can report what they are doing in the live "Running PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook" TUI status row
- Added inherited generated model catalog refreshes from models.dev, including newly listed models such as Kimi K2.7 Code for GitHub Copilot and Fable 5 providers ([#6256](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6256)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI screen corruption from external stdout writes: `console.log` from libraries or extensions while a TUI owns the terminal (interactive mode, startup dialogs, config selector) is now hidden from the screen and appended, redacted, to the debug log — matching the existing stderr guard.
- Fixed the live tool hook status row showing a generic `running builtin:hooks` label instead of the running command hook's configured `statusMessage` (falling back to its sanitized command text)
- Fixed startup model resolution to await available-model lookups before selecting defaults.
- Fixed pnpm self-update failures to show a prune hint when package-manager metadata blocks a self-update ([#6279](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6279) by [@rajp152k](https://github.com/rajp152k)).
- Fixed the edit tool schema to allow model-invented extra replacement fields instead of rejecting otherwise valid edits ([#6278](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6278)).
- Fixed inherited OAuth device-code polling to honor the server-provided `slow_down` interval so GitHub Copilot login recovers instead of appearing to hang when polls arrive early ([#6187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6187)).
- Fixed inherited OpenAI Codex WebSocket sessions to rotate cached connections before the backend's 60-minute limit, avoiding connection-limit failures on long sessions ([#6268](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6268)).
- Fixed inherited retry classification for Cloudflare 524 timeout responses ([#6239](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6239)).

### Removed

- Removed default attribution headers from Vercel AI Gateway requests.

## [2026.7.3] - 2026-07-03

### Added

### Changed

- Tightened the default dynamic system prompt: merged overlapping intent-gate rules, collapsed the redundant execution-stance bullets, removed the no-op "no trigger tools" line and decorative freedom rhetoric, and de-duplicated directives already covered by Policies. Same behavioral contract at about a third fewer tokens in the shared sections, across every model preset and the fallback prompt.
- Rewrote the Claude Opus 4.5–4.8 system prompt preset tuning against Anthropic's Opus prompting guidance: removed lines restating native model behavior, extended tools-over-reasoning guidance to Opus 4.7, compensated literal instruction following with evident-intent scoping, overrode the default frontend house style on 4.7/4.8, reduced post-user-turn re-reasoning on 4.8, and told all Opus presets not to wrap up early since senpi auto-compacts context.
- Rewrote the GPT-5.5 system prompt preset as a full outcome-first core (per the GPT-5.5 prompting guide) via a new `corePrompt` override on the dynamic prompt builder; behavior contracts (routing line, todo discipline, verification tiers, hard limits, file-operations routing) are preserved at roughly half the static prompt tokens. Other model presets are unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited startup model selection to skip unauthenticated saved defaults so configured local custom models can be selected instead.
- Fixed inherited Escape aborts to clear runs stuck in extension context hooks that ignore abort signals.
- Fixed the inherited question extension example to run question tool calls sequentially so multiple questions in one assistant turn remain answerable.

## [2026.7.2] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added public SDK exports for CLI-equivalent model and scoped-model resolution ([#6201](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6201)).
- Added extension entry renderers for persisted display-only session entries that are rendered in interactive mode without being sent to the model context.
- Added a Claude Fable 5 system prompt preset with auto-detection for `claude-fable-5` model IDs across built-in providers, selectable via `promptPreset: "claude-fable-5"`.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed startup model selection to skip unauthenticated saved defaults so configured local custom models can be selected instead ([#6231](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6231)).
- Fixed Escape aborts to clear runs stuck in extension context hooks that ignore abort signals ([#6234](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6234)).
- Fixed the question extension example to run question tool calls sequentially so multiple questions in one assistant turn remain answerable ([#6189](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6189)).
- Fixed `/login` to report auth storage persistence failures instead of claiming credentials were saved when `auth.json` is locked ([#6223](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6223)).
- Fixed split-turn compaction to serialize summary requests so single-concurrency local providers do not fail with 429 errors ([#5536](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5536)).
- Fixed custom session entries appended during assistant streaming to render before the live assistant message, matching persisted session order.
- Fixed oversized bash tool timeouts to fail with a clear validation error instead of being clamped to an immediate timeout ([#6181](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6181)).

## [2026.6.30-2] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added inherited Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5 model support.
- Added `get_entries` and `get_tree` RPC commands for reading session entries and tree snapshots over RPC ([#6078](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6078) by [@geraschenko](https://github.com/geraschenko)).
- Added session-name change events for extensions ([#6175](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6175) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Added an `outputPad` setting for user message, assistant message, and thinking horizontal padding ([#6168](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6168)).

### Changed

- Changed inherited OpenAI Codex Responses SSE response-header waits to use the configured HTTP timeout instead of the previous fixed 20 second timeout, reducing false timeouts on slow connections ([#4945](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4945)).

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited Claude Sonnet 5 metadata to use adaptive thinking payloads for Anthropic-compatible and Bedrock requests.
- Fixed inherited generated Xiaomi MiMo model pricing to match current pay-as-you-go pricing from models.dev ([#6138](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6138)).
- Fixed inherited provider HTTP errors to include response bodies instead of opaque SDK messages ([#5832](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5832) by [@stephanmck](https://github.com/stephanmck)).
- Fixed inherited Z.AI preserved thinking requests to send `thinking.clear_thinking: false` when thinking is enabled, allowing replayed `reasoning_content` to participate in provider caching ([#6083](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6083)).
- Fixed pre-prompt compaction to stop after compaction instead of continuing immediately ([#6074](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6074) by [@yzhg1983](https://github.com/yzhg1983)).
- Fixed extension tool changes to apply before the next provider request in the same agent run without dropping `before_agent_start` system-prompt overrides ([#6162](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6162)).
- Fixed a crash when undici emits an internal client error while terminating a mid-stream HTTP response ([#6133](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6133)).
- Fixed interactive status indicators so ending work, retry, compaction, or branch-summary indicators no longer shrink the TUI when clear-on-shrink is enabled ([#6026](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6026)).
- Fixed fork interactive working status updates to preserve elapsed timing and active tool labels after upstream status indicator changes.
- Fixed fork compaction status handling to preserve overflow/pre-prompt reasons and progress rendering after upstream merge.

- Renamed the inherited agent-core public harness shell execution options type from `ExecutionEnvExecOptions` to `ShellExecOptions`.

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited Anthropic-compatible custom models to use explicit compatibility metadata instead of provider-name heuristics for session-affinity headers and unsupported tool-field omissions.
- Fixed inherited request-scoped `apiKey` and `env` values to participate in provider auth resolution, so providers such as Cloudflare can derive request-specific base URLs from explicit call options ([#6021](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6021)).
- Restored inherited temporary legacy per-API stream aliases such as `streamSimpleOpenAICompletions` on the pi-ai compat entrypoint ([#6016](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6016), [#6017](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6017)).

- Fixed inherited Xiaomi and Xiaomi Token Plan model compatibility so thinking-mode conversations preserve DeepSeek-style reasoning replay requirements.
- Fixed inherited Amazon Bedrock Claude Opus 4.7 profile metadata to use the current inference profile IDs.
- Fixed extension `session_compact` events to include `willRetry` on accepted compactions.
- Fixed inherited OpenCode Go GLM-5.2 metadata to expose `xhigh` reasoning and send `reasoning_effort: "max"` ([#5967](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5967)).

## [0.79.10] - 2026-06-22

### New Features

- **Extension compaction event context** - Extension `session_before_compact` and `session_compact` events now include `reason` and `willRetry`, so extensions can distinguish manual `/compact`, threshold auto-compaction, and overflow retry flows. See [session_before_compact / session_compact](docs/extensions.md#session_before_compact--session_compact) and [Custom Summarization via Extensions](docs/compaction.md#custom-summarization-via-extensions).
- **Safer update flow** - `pi update` installs the exact checked Pi version, and update notices show the changelog URL, making upgrades more predictable. See [Install and Manage](docs/packages.md#install-and-manage).

### Added

- Added `reason` and `willRetry` metadata to extension `session_before_compact` and `session_compact` events so extensions can distinguish manual, threshold, and overflow compaction flows ([#5962](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5962) by [@PizzaMarinara](https://github.com/PizzaMarinara)).

- Fixed broken TUI documentation links to the plan-mode extension example ([#5957](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5957)).
- Fixed transient extension UI and session-start messages emitted during session replacement or reload so they remain visible, and kept reload input blocked until reload completes ([#5943](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5943)).
- Fixed the plan-mode example to preserve active custom tools, skip the action prompt when no plan is found, and queue refinement/execution follow-ups correctly from `agent_end` ([#5940](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5940)).
- Fixed `pi update` to install the exact version returned by the Pi update check, make `--force` reinstall that checked version, fail instead of falling back to an unversioned reinstall when no version is available, and report both the old and updated versions.
- Fixed update notifications to display the actual changelog URL as the hyperlink text.

## [2026.6.21] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Fixed the update notice to include a changelog URL when one is available.
- Fixed `pi update` to install the exact version returned by the Pi update check, make `--force` reinstall that checked version, fail instead of falling back to an unversioned reinstall when no version is available, and report both the old and updated versions.

## [0.79.9] - 2026-06-20

### New Features

- **Chat-template thinking compatibility** - OpenAI-compatible custom providers can map Pi thinking levels into `chat_template_kwargs`, enabling vLLM/Hugging Face chat-template models such as DeepSeek to use provider-native thinking controls. See [Custom Provider API Types](docs/custom-provider.md#api-types) and [OpenAI Compatibility](docs/models.md#openai-compatibility).
- **GLM-5.2 provider improvements** - GLM-5.2 now has corrected Fireworks OpenAI-compatible routing and OpenRouter `xhigh` thinking support, improving `/model` behavior and high-effort reasoning for GLM-5.2 users. See [Model Options](docs/usage.md#model-options).

### Added

- Added inherited configurable `chat-template` thinking support for OpenAI-compatible providers that use `chat_template_kwargs`, such as DeepSeek models behind vLLM ([#5673](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5673)).

- Fixed inherited Markdown streaming code fence rendering so partial closing fences no longer make code blocks shrink or flicker while content streams ([#5846](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5846) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Fixed fuzzy `edit` matches to preserve untouched line blocks instead of rewriting the whole file through normalized content ([#5899](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5899)).
- Fixed bash commands through legacy WSL `bash.exe` to pass scripts over stdin so shell variables expand in the target bash ([#5893](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5893)).
- Fixed `/model` to hide GitHub Copilot models that are unavailable to the authenticated account ([#5897](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5897)).
- Fixed `/model` selector search to rank exact provider-prefixed matches before proxy-provider model ID matches ([#5892](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5892)).

## [0.79.8] - 2026-06-19

### New Features

- **Selective provider base entry points** - SDK users can pair `@earendil-works/pi-ai/base` and `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/base` with explicit provider registration to keep bundled applications from including unused provider transports. See [`pi-ai` Base Entry Point](../ai/README.md#base-entry-point) and [`pi-agent-core` Base Entry Point](../agent/README.md#base-entry-point).
- **Mistral prompt caching** - Mistral sessions now use provider-side prompt caching with session affinity and cached-token usage/cost accounting. See [API Keys](docs/providers.md#api-keys) and [Environment Variables](docs/usage.md#environment-variables).
- **Post-compaction token estimates** - Compact results and compaction events now include estimated post-compaction token counts so clients can show the approximate context reduction. See [RPC compact](docs/rpc.md#compact) and [compaction events](docs/rpc.md#compaction_start--compaction_end).
- **OpenRouter Fusion alias** - `openrouter/fusion` is available as a built-in OpenRouter model alias. See [API Keys](docs/providers.md#api-keys).

### Added

- Added inherited `@earendil-works/pi-ai/base` and `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/base` entry points for selective provider registration in bundled applications ([#5348](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5348) by [@FredKSchott](https://github.com/FredKSchott)).

### Fixed

- Updated vulnerable runtime dependencies, including `undici` and the packaged `protobufjs` transitive dependency.
- Fixed compaction to refuse sessions with no eligible messages instead of producing empty summaries ([#4811](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4811)).
- Fixed successful overflow-triggered auto-compaction to avoid retrying completed assistant responses ([#5720](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5720)).

## [0.79.7] - 2026-06-18

### New Features

- **Automatic theme mode** - `/settings` can choose separate light and dark themes and follow terminal color-scheme changes. See [Selecting a Theme](docs/themes.md#selecting-a-theme).
- **Self-only updates by default** - `pi update` now updates pi only, with `pi update --all` for updating pi and packages together. See [Install and Manage](docs/packages.md#install-and-manage).

- Fixed `/model` autocomplete and model selection searches to match provider/model queries regardless of whether the provider or model token is typed first.
- Fixed the tree navigator to horizontally pan deep entries so the selected item remains readable ([#5830](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5830)).

## [0.79.6] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Fixed HTTP dispatcher configuration to preserve a caller's deliberate `fetch` override instead of reinstalling the undici global fetch over it.
- Fixed inherited OpenCode Go DeepSeek V4 thinking-off requests to send the provider's `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` compatibility parameter.

## [0.79.5] - 2026-06-16

### New Features

- **Provider-scoped API key environments** - `auth.json` API key entries can now include `env` overrides for provider-specific Cloudflare, Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, cache retention, and proxy settings without changing the project shell. See [Auth File](docs/providers.md#auth-file).
- **Global HTTP proxy setting** - Configure `httpProxy` once in global settings to apply `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` to Pi-managed HTTP clients. See [Network](docs/settings.md#network).

- Fixed `/tree` help rendering to show compact wrapped controls instead of truncating them on narrow terminals ([#5055](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5055)).
- Fixed SIGTERM/SIGHUP interactive shutdown to keep signal handlers installed until terminal cleanup completes, preventing `signal-exit` from re-sending the signal and leaving the terminal in raw/Kitty keyboard mode ([#5724](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5724)).
- Fixed extensions documentation to clarify that `pi.getActiveTools()` returns active tool names while `pi.getAllTools()` returns tool metadata ([#5729](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5729)).
- Fixed question and questionnaire extension examples to wrap long prompt, option, and help text instead of truncating it ([#5708](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5708) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).

- Fixed `pi update` for pnpm global installs whose configured `global-bin-dir` no longer matches the active pnpm home ([#5689](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5689)).
- Fixed npm package specs that use ranges or tags (for example `@^1.2.7`) so installed package resources still load instead of being treated as mismatched exact pins ([#5695](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5695)).
- Fixed inherited Anthropic 1-hour prompt-cache write cost accounting to price 1-hour cache writes at 2x input instead of the 5-minute cache-write rate ([#5738](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5738) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky)).

- Fixed custom provider config so plain uppercase API key and header values remain literals instead of being treated as legacy environment references; use explicit `$ENV_VAR` syntax for environment variables ([#5661](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5661)).

## [0.79.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited OpenAI GPT-5.4/GPT-5.5 and OpenAI Codex GPT-5.4/GPT-5.4 mini/GPT-5.5 context window metadata to use the observed 272k-token Codex backend limit, avoiding a billing hazard from prompts above Codex's accepted limit (reported by [@trethore](https://github.com/trethore)).

## [0.79.2] - 2026-06-12

### New Features

- **Clearer Bedrock validation guidance** - Amazon Bedrock data retention validation errors now link to AWS data retention documentation. See [Amazon Bedrock](docs/providers.md#amazon-bedrock).

### Added

- Added an experimental first-time setup flow behind `PI_EXPERIMENTAL=1` that asks for a dark/light theme choice (preselecting the detected appearance) and opt-in analytics data sharing on first launch with the default agent directory; opting in stores a `trackingId` in `settings.json` ([#5587](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5587) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti)).
- Added AWS data retention documentation links to inherited Amazon Bedrock unsupported data retention mode validation errors ([#5561](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5561) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge)).

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited late tool progress callbacks after tool settlement to be ignored instead of emitting stale `tool_execution_update` events ([#5573](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5573)).
- Fixed inherited user-message transcript rendering so standalone `+` messages no longer render as `-` ([#5657](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5657)).
- Fixed inherited slash-separated fuzzy queries so provider/model completions remain matchable after insertion.
- Fixed inherited WezTerm inline Kitty image rendering so reserved row clears do not erase all but the top strip of tool image previews ([#5618](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5618)).
- Fixed inherited editor wrapping for CJK text to break at character boundaries instead of leaving large trailing gaps ([#5585](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5585) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu)).
- Fixed inherited loose Markdown list rendering to preserve blank-line separation between list items ([#5562](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5562) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence)).

- Fixed `/fork` to keep session parent chains connected when the forked path contains labels ([#5669](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5669)).
- Fixed `/share` and `/export` HTML exports to use the active fallback theme when the configured custom theme no longer exists ([#5596](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5596)).
- Fixed custom fallback model IDs with `:<thinking>` suffixes to preserve the requested thinking level when the provider template model does not advertise reasoning ([#5560](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5560) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu)).

## [0.79.1] - 2026-06-09

### New Features

- **Claude Fable 5** - Claude Fable 5 is now available on the Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock providers, with adaptive thinking and `xhigh` effort support.
- **Prompt template defaults** - Prompt templates can use default positional arguments such as `${1:-7}` for optional values. See [Prompt Template Arguments](docs/prompt-templates.md#arguments).
- **Configurable project trust defaults** - `defaultProjectTrust` lets users choose whether unresolved project trust asks, always trusts, or never trusts by default, and extensions can inspect effective trust decisions. See [Project Trust](docs/security.md#project-trust) and [`ctx.isProjectTrusted()`](docs/extensions.md#ctxisprojecttrusted).
- **Natural extension autocomplete triggers** - Extension autocomplete providers can declare trigger characters such as `#` or `$` so suggestions open without slash-command prefixes. See [Autocomplete Providers](docs/extensions.md#autocomplete-providers).

### Added

- Added default-value expansion for prompt template positional arguments, e.g. `${1:-7}` ([#5553](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5553) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote)).

- Added extension autocomplete trigger character support for `ctx.ui.addAutocompleteProvider()` wrappers ([#4703](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4703)).
- Added Claude Fable 5 model support inherited from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` for the Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock providers, with adaptive thinking and `xhigh` effort support.

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited Amazon Bedrock inference profile ARN region resolution to prefer the ARN's embedded region over `AWS_REGION` ([#5527](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5527) by [@AJM10565](https://github.com/AJM10565)).
- Fixed inherited IME hardware cursor positioning while slash-command autocomplete is visible ([#5283](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5283) by [@smoosex](https://github.com/smoosex)).

- Fixed inherited Azure GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.5 context window metadata to 1,050,000 tokens, matching Azure Foundry deployments instead of OpenAI's 272k limit ([#5559](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5559)).
- Fixed inherited OpenAI and Azure GPT-5 Pro `maxTokens` metadata to 128,000, correcting an upstream value that duplicated the input sub-limit as the output limit ([#5559](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5559)).
- Fixed inherited prompt history navigation to restore the current draft when returning from history browsing ([#5494](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5494)).
- Fixed inherited wrapping for mixed Latin and CJK text so unspaced CJK runs can break at grapheme boundaries without leaving large trailing gaps ([#5495](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5495)).
- Fixed extension OAuth login prompts to keep previous submitted prompt rows stable instead of mirroring the active input value ([#5433](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5433)).

- Fixed CLI help and version output, including plain redirected `--help`/`--version` output and simplified `list`/`config` help text.
- Fixed `/new` from ephemeral sessions to keep the new session ephemeral instead of persisting it by default ([#5045](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5045)).
- Clarified custom model docs that `name` and `modelOverrides.name` do not replace model IDs in the footer or primary model lists ([#4841](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4841)).

## [0.79.0] - 2026-06-08

### New Features

- **Project trust for local inputs** - Pi now asks before loading project-local settings, resources, instructions, and packages, with saved decisions and `--approve` / `--no-approve` controls for non-interactive modes. See [Project Trust](README.md#project-trust).
- **Extension-controlled trust decisions** - Global and CLI extensions can handle `project_trust`, decide, remember, or defer project trust before project-local resources load. See [`project_trust`](docs/extensions.md#project_trust).
- **Cache-hit visibility in the footer** - The interactive footer now shows the latest prompt cache hit rate (`CH`). See [Interactive Mode](README.md#interactive-mode).
- **Richer SDK and RPC extension surfaces** - Public exports now include RPC extension UI request/response types and package asset path helpers. See [Extension UI Protocol](docs/rpc.md#extension-ui-protocol) and [SDK Exports](docs/sdk.md#exports).

### Added

- Added a `project_trust` extension event so global and CLI extensions can decide or defer project trust during startup and runtime cwd switches.
- Added project trust gating for project-local settings, resources, instructions, and packages ([#5332](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5332)).

- Fixed inherited TUI rendering to clear stale lines when content shrinks to zero.
- Fixed inherited autocomplete suggestions to refresh after editor cursor movement ([#5499](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5499) by [@Roman-Galeev](https://github.com/Roman-Galeev)).
- Fixed `/reload` to persist project trust when an implicitly trusted session creates a project `.pi` directory.
- Fixed project trust input discovery to traverse parent directories portably.
- Fixed inherited intermittent Shift+Enter handling by making Kitty keyboard protocol fallback response-driven instead of timeout-driven ([#5188](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5188)).
- Fixed the compaction summarization system prompt to use neutral AI assistant wording for non-coding agents ([#5401](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5401)).
- Fixed `models.json` schema support and inherited OpenAI Responses custom-provider handling for `compat.supportsDeveloperRole: false` ([#5456](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5456)).
- Fixed inherited prompt history navigation to place the cursor at the start when browsing upward and at the end when browsing downward ([#5454](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5454)).
- Fixed tmux setup documentation to require tmux 3.5 for `extended-keys-format csi-u` and document the tmux 3.2-3.4 fallback ([#5432](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5432)).
- Fixed inherited OpenRouter routing preferences on OpenAI-compatible custom providers to work when the custom provider base URL does not point directly at OpenRouter ([#5347](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5347)).
- Fixed built-in tool expand hints to style closing parentheses consistently ([#5359](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5359)).
- Fixed skill-wrapped prompts to insert spacing between skill instructions and the user message ([#5371](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5371) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence)).

## [0.78.1] - 2026-06-04

### New Features

- **More built-in provider coverage** - Added Ant Ling and NVIDIA NIM provider setup, plus MiniMax-M3 support for the direct MiniMax providers. See [Providers](docs/providers.md).
- **Richer extension context** - Extensions can use `ctx.mode` and `ctx.getSystemPromptOptions()` to adapt behavior across TUI, RPC, JSON, and print modes and inspect base system prompt inputs. See [Extensions](docs/extensions.md).

### Added

- Added containerization documentation and a Gondolin extension example for routing built-in tools into a local micro-VM.
- Added Ant Ling provider selection and setup documentation.
- Added MiniMax-M3 model support inherited from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` for the `minimax` and `minimax-cn` direct providers ([#5313](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5313)).
- Added NVIDIA NIM provider selection, setup documentation, and direct NIM request attribution headers.
- Added `ctx.mode` to extension contexts so extensions can distinguish TUI, RPC, JSON, and print mode.
- Added `ctx.getSystemPromptOptions()` for extension commands to inspect the current base system prompt inputs ([#5306](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5306) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).

### Fixed

- Fixed temporary extension package installs to use a private `~/.pi/agent/tmp/extensions` directory with `0700` permissions instead of `os.tmpdir()/pi-extensions`.
- Fixed git package source handling to reject unsafe host/path components and keep managed clone paths inside install roots.
- Fixed stored XSS in HTML session exports by sanitizing Markdown link and image URLs with a scheme allow-list after stripping control characters.
- Fixed SDK embedding in bundled Node apps failing with `ENOENT` when `package.json` is not present next to the bundle entrypoint. The package metadata reader now gracefully handles missing `package.json` by using defaults, enabling `createAgentSession()` without requiring package-adjacent files at runtime ([#5226](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5226)).
- Fixed HTTP timeout setting not being respected for non-Codex providers (e.g., llama.cpp via OpenAI-compatible API). The `httpIdleTimeoutMs` setting (set via `/settings` HTTP timeout) now applies as the default SDK request timeout for all providers that support it, not just OpenAI Codex Responses. Disabling the timeout (HTTP timeout = false) now correctly disables SDK timeouts for all supported providers by sending a maximum int32 value (effectively infinite) instead of 0, since SDKs treat timeout=0 as an immediate timeout ([#5294](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5294)).
- Fixed inherited Amazon Bedrock requests to replace blank required user/tool-result text with a placeholder and skip blank replay text blocks ([#4975](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4975)).
- Fixed inherited Anthropic Claude Opus 4.7+ requests to suppress deprecated temperature parameters ([#5251](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5251) by [@yzhg1983](https://github.com/yzhg1983)).
- Fixed inherited OpenAI GPT-5.5 generated metadata to omit unsupported minimal thinking ([#5243](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5243)).
- Fixed inherited OpenRouter Kimi K2.6 thinking replay and developer-role instruction handling ([#5309](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5309)).
- Fixed inherited OpenRouter reasoning instruction requests to preserve the system role when required ([#5221](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5221) by [@PriNova](https://github.com/PriNova)).
- Fixed inherited overlay focus restoration so non-capturing overlays remain interactive after UI rerenders and explicit focus release ([#5235](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5235) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon)).
- Fixed inherited tab width accounting in column slicing and overlay compositing so tab-containing output cannot exceed the terminal width ([#5218](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5218)).
- Fixed opening and listing very large JSONL session files by reading session entries line-by-line instead of materializing the full file as one string ([#5231](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5231)).
- Fixed the footer branch display in WSL `/mnt/...` repositories to refresh after branch changes ([#5264](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5264) by [@psoukie](https://github.com/psoukie)).
- Fixed `renderShell: "self"` tool renderers that emit no component lines leaving a blank chat row ([#5299](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5299)).
- Restored inherited NVIDIA Qwen 3.5 122B NIM model support.

## [0.78.0] - 2026-05-29

### New Features

- **Named startup sessions** - `--name` / `-n` sets the session display name before startup across interactive, print, JSON, and RPC modes. See [Naming Sessions](docs/sessions.md#naming-sessions) and [Session Options](docs/usage.md#session-options).
- **Clickable file tool paths** - built-in file tool titles render OSC 8 `file://` hyperlinks when the terminal supports them, including supported tmux clients.

### Added

- Exported `convertToPng` for extension authors ([#5167](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/5167) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Exported `parseArgs` and type `Args` for extension authors ([#5202](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/5202) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Added `--name` / `-n` to set the session display name at startup ([#5153](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/5153)).

- Fixed the GitLab Duo custom provider example to use adaptive thinking for Claude models, expose xhigh thinking, and include newer verified model IDs ([#5201](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/5201)).
- Fixed Bun release archive creation to install and copy the matching `@mariozechner/clipboard` base package and native sidecars ([#5184](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/5184)).
- Fixed early interactive input typed before the prompt loop starts so it is buffered instead of dropped ([#5195](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/5195) by [@yzhg1983](https://github.com/yzhg1983)).
- Fixed OpenRouter Moonshot Kimi K2.6 requests to use `system` instead of unsupported `developer` messages ([#5159](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/5159)).
- Fixed OpenCode Go Kimi K2.6 thinking requests to send `thinking` objects instead of invalid string values, and fixed OpenCode Zen Grok Build thinking requests to omit unsupported `reasoning_effort` ([#5169](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/5169)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses SSE streams to abort response body reads after terminal events.
- Fixed OpenCode Kimi K2.6 generated metadata to use Anthropic-style thinking metadata instead of invalid reasoning-effort parameters.

- **Selective tool disablement** - `--exclude-tools` / `-xt` disables specific built-in, extension, or custom tools while leaving the rest available. See [Tool Options](docs/usage.md#tool-options).
- **Headless Codex subscription login** - `/login` can use device-code auth for ChatGPT Plus/Pro Codex subscriptions. See [Subscriptions](docs/providers.md#subscriptions) and [OpenAI Codex](docs/providers.md#openai-codex).
- **Streaming-aware extension input** - extensions can distinguish idle prompts, mid-stream steers, and queued follow-ups with `InputEvent.streamingBehavior`. See [Input Events](docs/extensions.md#input-events).

### Added

- Added `--exclude-tools` / `-xt` to disable specific built-in, extension, or custom tools while leaving the rest available ([#5109](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5109)).
- Added OpenAI Codex subscription device-code login as a selectable headless alternative while keeping browser login as the default ([#4911](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/4911) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti)).

- Fixed custom session directories so current-folder resume/continue lookups stay scoped to the active cwd while all-session listings cover the custom directory.
- Fixed SIGTERM/SIGHUP exits to run extension `session_shutdown` cleanup and restore the terminal: signal-triggered shutdown now emits `session_shutdown` before any terminal writes, and SIGHUP no longer hard-exits, so extension resources (e.g. sockets) are released even when the terminal is gone ([#5080](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5080)).
- Fixed keyboard protocol negotiation to ignore mismatched or delayed terminal responses, avoiding false Kitty keyboard protocol detection ([#5091](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5091) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).
- Fixed Windows startup crashes under MSYS2 ucrt64 Node.js by updating the native clipboard addon to napi-rs 3.x ([#5028](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5028)).
- Fixed API key and header config resolution to treat plain strings as literals, support `$ENV_VAR` / `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation and `$!` bang escaping, and require explicit env syntax for config files, avoiding Windows case-insensitive env matches corrupting literal keys ([#5095](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5095)).
- Fixed session disposal to abort in-flight agent, compaction, branch summary, retry, and bash work ([#5029](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5029) by [@TerminallyChilI](https://github.com/TerminallyChilI)).
- Fixed `pi.getAllTools()` to expose each tool's `promptGuidelines` for extensions that need per-tool guideline attribution ([#4879](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4879)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses replay after switching from Anthropic extended-thinking sessions by generating unique fallback message item IDs for converted thinking/text blocks ([#5148](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5148)).
- Fixed Anthropic-compatible replay for providers that return empty thinking signatures by adding an opt-in `allowEmptySignature` compatibility flag ([#4464](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4464)).

- Fixed extension input events to report `streamingBehavior` only for prompts actually queued during streaming ([#5107](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5107) by [@DanielThomas](https://github.com/DanielThomas)).
- Fixed system prompt tool-selection guidance to avoid preferring unavailable file exploration tools ([#5132](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5132)).
- Fixed fenced `diff` code blocks and other highlight.js scopes to keep theme-aware syntax colors after the `cli-highlight` replacement ([#5092](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5092)).

## [0.76.0] - 2026-05-27

### New Features

- **Explicit session IDs for automation** - `--session-id <id>` lets scripts create or resume an exact project-local session. See [Sessions](docs/usage.md#sessions).
- **RPC bash output can stay out of model context** - RPC clients can pass `excludeFromContext` to `bash` for commands whose output should not be sent with the next prompt. See [RPC mode](docs/rpc.md#bash).

- Fixed self-update commands to bypass npm, pnpm, and Bun minimum release age gates for explicit `pi update` runs ([#4929](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4929)).
- Fixed context token estimates to count user image attachments consistently with tool result images ([#4983](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4983)).
- Fixed `httpIdleTimeoutMs` to apply to OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket idle waits, added `websocketConnectTimeoutMs` for bounded WebSocket connect waits, and added a 10s Codex SSE response-header timeout ([#4945](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4945)).
- Fixed `RpcClient` to reject pending requests and consume stdin pipe errors when the child process exits unexpectedly ([#4764](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4764)).
- Fixed managed npm extension updates to avoid package managers installing or resolving pi host packages as peer dependencies ([#4907](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4907)).

- Fixed `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` model metadata to use its 128k context window ([#4969](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4969)).
- Fixed OpenRouter/Poolside context overflow detection for `maximum allowed input length` errors ([#4943](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4943)).
- Fixed provider retry controls so `retry.provider.maxRetries` is honored, SDK retries default to `0`, and quota/billing 429s are not retried behind Pi's retry handling ([#4991](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4991) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).
- Fixed Apple Terminal `Shift+Enter` by detecting local macOS modifier state when Terminal.app sends plain Return.

## [0.75.5] - 2026-05-23

### New Features

- **Cleaner read tool output** - Collapsed `read` tool cards now show only the read line by default, while `Ctrl+O` still expands the full file content.
- **Faster file tools on Windows** - Built-in file tools now use async filesystem operations during streaming, and image resizes run off the main TUI thread in a worker.
- **More reliable package updates** - `pi update` and git package installs now reconcile pinned git refs and keep package settings intact. See [Packages](docs/packages.md).
- **Custom Anthropic-compatible adaptive thinking** - Custom provider model configs can opt into adaptive-thinking Claude behavior with `compat.forceAdaptiveThinking`. See [Custom providers](docs/custom-provider.md) and [Models](docs/models.md).

### Added

- Added `compat.forceAdaptiveThinking` support to custom Anthropic-compatible model configuration docs and validation ([#4797](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4797) by [@mbazso](https://github.com/mbazso)).

## [0.75.4] - 2026-05-20

### New Features

- **Hardened npm install and release path** - Pi now ships the CLI with a generated shrinkwrap for transitive dependencies, blocks accidental lockfile changes, verifies dependency pinning and lifecycle-script allowlists in checks, disables lifecycle scripts for self-update and local release installs where supported, and smoke-tests isolated npm and Bun installs before release. See [Supply-chain hardening](../../README.md#supply-chain-hardening).

### Added

- Added interactive update notes after `pi update` runs, so users can see the installed version's changelog before continuing ([#4724](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4724) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).

## [0.74.0] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- Updated repository links and package references for the move to `earendil-works/pi-mono` and `@earendil-works/*` package scopes.

## [0.73.1] - 2026-05-07

### New Features

- **Self-update support for the npm scope migration**: `pi update --self` now supports the upcoming package rename from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. After the new package is published, existing global installs can update through the normal self-update flow; pi will uninstall the old global package and install the package name returned by the version check endpoint.
- **Interactive OAuth login selection**: OAuth providers can now present multiple login choices in `/login`, enabling provider-specific interactive authentication flows. See [Providers](docs/providers.md).
- **JSONC-style `models.json` parsing**: `models.json` now allows comments and trailing commas, making custom provider and model configuration easier to maintain. See [Providers](docs/providers.md) and [Custom Providers](docs/custom-provider.md).

### Added

- Added interactive login selection support so OAuth providers can present multiple login choices ([#4190](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4190) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).

### Changed

- Changed `pi update --self` to honor the active package name returned by the Pi version check endpoint, defaulting to the current package when omitted and uninstalling the old global package before installing a renamed package.
- Changed extension loading to use upstream `jiti` 2.7 instead of the `@mariozechner/jiti` fork ([#4244](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4244) by [@pi0](https://github.com/pi0)).
- Changed `models.json` parsing to allow comments and trailing commas ([#4162](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4162) by [@julien-c](https://github.com/julien-c)).

### Fixed

- Fixed `pi -p` treating prompts that start with YAML frontmatter as extension flags instead of user messages ([#4163](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4163)).
- Fixed pending tool results not updating in the live TUI after toggling thinking block visibility while the tool is running ([#4167](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4167)).
- Fixed `/copy` reporting success on Linux without writing the clipboard on Wayland-only compositors (Hyprland, Niri, ...) by skipping the X11-only native addon on Linux and routing through `wl-copy`/`xclip`/`xsel` instead ([#4177](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4177)).
- Fixed HTML session exports to strip skill wrapper XML from rendered user messages ([#4234](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4234) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible chat completion streams that interleave content and tool-call deltas in the same choice.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex OAuth refresh failures writing directly to stderr while the TUI is active ([#4141](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4141)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses requests to send a non-empty system prompt ([#4184](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4184)).
- Fixed Kimi For Coding model resolution for the Kimi K2 P6 alias ([#4218](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4218)).
- Fixed Kitty inline image redraws to stay within TUI-owned terminal regions and avoid writing below the active viewport.
- Fixed Kitty inline image rendering by letting the terminal allocate image ids and bounding parsed image ids to valid values.
- Fixed inline image capability detection to disable inline images in cmux terminals.

## [0.73.0] - 2026-05-04

### New Features

- **Xiaomi MiMo API billing and regional Token Plan providers** - `xiaomi` now uses API billing, with separate `xiaomi-token-plan-{cn,ams,sgp}` providers. See [docs/providers.md#api-keys](docs/providers.md#api-keys) and [README.md#providers--models](README.md#providers--models). ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode))
- **Incremental bash output streaming** - Bash tool output now appears while commands run instead of only after completion. ([#4145](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4145))
- **Compact read rendering** - Interactive `read` output for Pi docs, context files, and skills is collapsed by default and shows selected line ranges.

### Breaking Changes

- Switched the built-in `xiaomi` provider from Token Plan AMS to Xiaomi's API billing endpoint, and renamed its `/login` display from "Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan" to "Xiaomi MiMo". `XIAOMI_API_KEY` now refers to the API billing key from [platform.xiaomimimo.com](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com). Users on Token Plan should switch to the appropriate `xiaomi-token-plan-*` provider and set the corresponding env var ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).

### Added

- Added three Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan regional providers visible in `/login`: `xiaomi-token-plan-cn` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_CN_API_KEY`), `xiaomi-token-plan-ams` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_AMS_API_KEY`), `xiaomi-token-plan-sgp` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_SGP_API_KEY`). Each defaults to `mimo-v2.5-pro` ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).

### Changed

- Changed `read` tool rendering to collapse Pi documentation, AGENTS/CLAUDE context files, and `SKILL.md` contents by default in interactive output.

### Fixed

- Fixed generated OpenAI-compatible model metadata for Qwen 3.5/3.6 and MiniMax M2.7, so those models work through the built-in provider catalog ([#4110](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4110) by [@jsynowiec](https://github.com/jsynowiec)).
- Fixed Bedrock Claude Opus 4.7 `xhigh` thinking requests by preserving the provider's native effort value.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket transport to fall back to SSE when setup fails before streaming starts, and surface transport diagnostics in the assistant message ([#4133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4133)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket transport keeping `--print` and JSON mode processes alive after the response by closing cached WebSocket sessions during session shutdown ([#4103](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4103)).
- Fixed compact `read` tool calls to render directly and include selected line ranges in interactive output.
- Fixed interactive sessions to exit when terminal input is lost instead of continuing in a broken state.
- Fixed bash tool output to stream incrementally while commands run instead of waiting for command completion ([#4145](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4145)).
- Fixed selector and autocomplete fuzzy ranking to prioritize exact matches.

## [0.72.1] - 2026-05-02

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md). ([#4005](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4005) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).
- **Model thinking level metadata** - Models can now declare which thinking levels they support via `thinkingLevelMap`, replacing the old `reasoningEffortMap`. See [docs/models.md#thinking-level-map](docs/models.md#thinking-level-map) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md). ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)).
- **Custom provider base URL overrides** - `pi.registerProvider()` now respects per-model `baseUrl` settings. See [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md). ([#4063](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4063)).
- **Post-turn stop callback** - Agent loop can now exit gracefully after a completed turn via `shouldStopAfterTurn`. See [`packages/agent/README.md`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/agent/README.md).
- **Self-update detection fix** - `pi` now correctly identifies and applies available updates. ([#3942](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3942), [#3980](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3980), [#3922](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3922)).

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `compat.reasoningEffortMap` in `models.json` and `pi.registerProvider()` model definitions with model-level `thinkingLevelMap` ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)). Migration: move old mappings from `compat.reasoningEffortMap` to `thinkingLevelMap`. Use string values for provider-specific thinking values and `null` for unsupported pi levels that should be hidden and skipped by cycling. See `docs/models.md#thinking-level-map` and `docs/custom-provider.md`.

### Added

- Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan provider support with `XIAOMI_API_KEY`, default model resolution, `/login` display support, and provider documentation ([#4005](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4005) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).
- Added model-level `thinkingLevelMap` support in `models.json` and `pi.registerProvider()`, allowing models to expose only the thinking levels they actually support ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)).
- Added `shouldStopAfterTurn` agent loop callback for post-turn stop control, inherited from `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`. See [`packages/agent/README.md`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/agent/README.md).

### Fixed

- Fixed the default transport setting to use `auto`, allowing OpenAI Codex to use cached WebSocket context when available ([#4083](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4083)).
- Fixed `pi.registerProvider()` to honor per-model `baseUrl` overrides ([#4063](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4063)).
- Fixed self-update detection so `pi` correctly identifies when a newer version is available and applies updates ([#3942](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3942), [#3980](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3980), [#3922](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3922)).

## [0.71.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added `websocket-cached` to the transport setting options for the OpenAI Codex provider used with ChatGPT subscription auth. This keeps the same WebSocket open for a session and, after the first request, sends only the new conversation items instead of resending the full chat history when possible.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- Removed built-in Google Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity support. Existing configurations using those providers must switch to another supported provider.

- Extension APIs can replace finalized `message_end` messages, wrap custom editor factories via `ctx.ui.getEditorComponent()`, and observe thinking level changes. See [docs/extensions.md#message_start--message_update--message_end](docs/extensions.md#message_start--message_update--message_end), [docs/extensions.md#widgets-status-and-footer](docs/extensions.md#widgets-status-and-footer), and [docs/extensions.md#thinking_level_select](docs/extensions.md#thinking_level_select).
- `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` configures session storage from the environment. See [docs/usage.md#environment-variables](docs/usage.md#environment-variables).

- Added `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` as an environment equivalent to `--session-dir` ([#4027](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4027)).
- Added `message_end` extension result support for replacing finalized messages, enabling extensions to override assistant usage cost ([#3982](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3982)).
- Added top-level `name` support to `pi.registerProvider()` so extension-registered providers can show a friendly name in `/login` ([#3956](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3956)).
- Added `ctx.ui.getEditorComponent()` so extensions can wrap the currently configured custom editor factory ([#3935](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3935)).
- Added a `thinking_level_select` extension event for observing thinking level changes ([#3888](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3888)).

- Fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash and V4 Pro pricing metadata to match current official rates ([#3910](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3910)).
- Updated the sandbox extension example lockfile to resolve the vulnerable `lodash-es` transitive dependency ([#3901](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3901)).
- Fixed DeepSeek prompt cache hits to be tracked from OpenAI-compatible usage responses ([#3880](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3880)).

- Fixed Cloudflare Workers AI attribution headers to honor the install telemetry setting.
- Fixed `pi update --self` detection and execution for Windows package-manager shim installs, including symlinked global package roots, and print the manual fallback command when self-update fails ([#3857](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3857)).

## [0.70.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed HTML export preserving ANSI-renderer trailing padding as extra blank wrapped lines.

## [0.70.4] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed packaged `pi` startup failing because the session selector imported a source-only utility path.

- Extension-controlled working row visibility via `ctx.ui.setWorkingVisible()`, allowing extensions to hide the built-in loader row and render custom working state. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/border-status-editor.ts](examples/extensions/border-status-editor.ts). ([#3674](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3674))

### Added

- Added `pi update` support for updating pi itself in addition to installed pi packages ([#3680](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3680) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).
- Added Azure Cognitive Services endpoint support for Azure OpenAI Responses base URLs ([#3799](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3799) by [@marcbloech](https://github.com/marcbloech)).
- Added `warnings.anthropicExtraUsage` and a `/settings` warnings submenu to suppress the Anthropic extra usage billing warning ([#3808](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3808))
- Added `ctx.ui.setWorkingVisible()` so extensions can hide the built-in interactive working loader row without reserving layout space, plus a border-status editor example that moves working state into a custom editor border ([#3674](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3674))

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate printable characters from Kitty keyboard protocol CSI-u plus raw character input on layouts such as Italian ([#3780](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3780)).
- Fixed API-key environment discovery and Bun startup to fall back to `/proc/self/environ` when Bun's sandbox leaves `process.env` empty ([#3801](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3801) by [@mdsjip](https://github.com/mdsjip)).
- Fixed Bun sandboxed package-manager commands when `process.env` is empty ([#3807](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3807) by [@mdsjip](https://github.com/mdsjip)).
- Fixed symlinked packages, resources, skills, and sessions being duplicated in selectors and loaders ([#3818](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3818) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).
- Fixed Bedrock prompt-caching and adaptive-thinking capability checks for inference profile ARNs ([#3527](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3527) by [@anirudhmarc](https://github.com/anirudhmarc)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses default verbosity to `low` when no verbosity is specified.
- Stopped sending empty `tools` arrays to providers that reject them when tools are disabled ([#3650](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3650) by [@HQidea](https://github.com/HQidea)).
- Fixed Anthropic SSE parsing to ignore unknown proxy events such as OpenAI-style `done` terminators ([#3708](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3708)).
- Fixed provider registration with override-only `models.json` entries to preserve built-in model lists ([#3651](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3651)).
- Fixed `/login` to show auth supplied by `models.json` provider definitions.

## [0.70.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed provider retry/timeout forwarding to omit undefined provider request controls, avoiding downstream SDK validation errors such as `timeout must be an integer` when `retry.provider.timeoutMs` is not configured ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))

## [0.70.1] - 2026-04-24

### New Features

- DeepSeek provider support with V4 Flash/Pro models and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` authentication. See [README.md#providers--models](README.md#providers--models) and [docs/providers.md#api-keys](docs/providers.md#api-keys).
- Provider request timeout/retry controls via `retry.provider.{timeoutMs,maxRetries,maxRetryDelayMs}`, useful for long-running local inference and provider SDK retry behavior. See [docs/settings.md#retry](docs/settings.md#retry). ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))

### Added

- Added DeepSeek to built-in provider setup, default model resolution, and provider documentation.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/copy` to avoid unbounded OSC 52 writes and clipboard races that could break terminal rendering or panic the native clipboard addon ([#3639](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3639))
- Fixed extension flag docs to show `pi.getFlag()` using registered flag names without the CLI `--` prefix ([#3614](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3614))
- Fixed provider retry/timeout settings wiring by adding `retry.provider.{timeoutMs,maxRetries,maxRetryDelayMs}`, migrating legacy `retry.maxDelayMs`, and forwarding provider controls into `streamSimple` request options ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))
- Fixed Windows git package installs to bypass `cmd.exe` for native git commands, so install paths containing spaces no longer break `pi install git:...` with `fatal: Too many arguments` ([#3642](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3642))
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 session replay 400 errors by sending DeepSeek-compatible thinking controls and replayed assistant `reasoning_content` fields ([#3636](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3636))
- Fixed GPT-5.5 generated context window metadata to use the observed 272k limit.
- Fixed CSI-u Ctrl+letter decoding inside bracketed paste, so pasted modified-key escape sequences no longer become literal editor text ([#3623](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3623) by [@Exrun94](https://github.com/Exrun94))

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

### New Features

- Searchable auth provider login flow: the `/login` provider selector now supports fuzzy search/filtering, making it faster to find providers when many are configured. See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md). ([#3572](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3572) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- GPT-5.5 Codex support: `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` is available as a model option, including `xhigh` reasoning support and corrected priority-tier pricing.
- Terminal progress indicators are now opt-in: OSC 9;4 progress reporting during streaming/compaction is off by default and can be toggled via `terminal.showTerminalProgress` in `/settings` ([#3588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3588))
- `--no-builtin-tools` / `createAgentSession({ noTools: "builtin" })` now correctly disables only built-in tools while keeping extension tools active. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [README.md](README.md) ([#3592](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3592))

### Breaking Changes

- Disabled OSC 9;4 terminal progress indicators by default. Set `terminal.showTerminalProgress` to `true` in `/settings` to re-enable ([#3588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3588))

### Added

- Added searchable auth provider login flow with fuzzy filtering in the provider selector ([#3572](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3572) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Added GPT-5.5 Codex model
- Added auth source labels in `/login` so provider entries can show when auth comes from `--api-key`, an environment variable, or custom provider fallback without exposing secrets.

### Changed

- Updated default model selection across providers to current recommended models.
- Improved stale extension context errors after session replacement or reload to tell extension authors to avoid captured `pi`/command `ctx` and use `withSession` for post-replacement work.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/model` selector cancellation to request render instead of incorrectly triggering login selector.
- Changed login, OAuth, and extension selectors for more consistent styling.
- Added Amazon Bedrock setup guidance to `/login` and updated `/model` copy to refer to configured providers instead of only API keys.
- Improved no-model and missing-auth warnings to point users to `/login` for OAuth or API key setup.
- Fixed `/quit` shutdown ordering to stop the TUI before extension UI teardown can repaint, preserving the final rendered frame while still emitting `session_shutdown` before process exit.
- Fixed `SettingsManager.inMemory()` initial settings being lost after reloads triggered by SDK resource loading ([#3616](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3616))
- Fixed `models.json` provider compatibility to accept `compat.supportsLongCacheRetention`, allowing proxies to opt out of long-retention cache fields when needed while long retention is enabled by default when requested ([#3543](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3543))
- Fixed `--thinking xhigh` for `openai-codex` `gpt-5.5` so it is no longer downgraded to `high`.
- Fixed git package installs with custom `npmCommand` values such as `pnpm` by avoiding npm-specific production flags in that compatibility path ([#3604](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3604))
- Fixed first user messages rendering without spacing after existing notices such as compaction summaries or status messages ([#3613](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3613))
- Fixed the handoff extension example to use the replacement-session context after creating a new session, avoiding stale `ctx` errors when it installs the generated prompt ([#3606](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3606))
- Fixed session replacement and `/quit` teardown ordering to run host-owned extension UI cleanup synchronously after `session_shutdown` handlers complete but before invalidating the old extension context, preventing stale extension UI from rendering against a disposed session ([#3597](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3597) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti))
- Fixed crash on `/quit` when an extension registers a custom footer whose `render()` accesses `ctx`, by tearing down extension-provided UI before invalidating the extension runner during shutdown ([#3595](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3595))
- Fixed auto-retry to treat Bedrock/Smithy HTTP/2 transport failures like `http2 request did not get a response` as transient errors, so the agent retries automatically instead of waiting for a manual nudge ([#3594](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3594))
- Fixed the CLI/SDK tool-selection split so `--no-builtin-tools` and `createAgentSession({ noTools: "builtin" })` disable only built-in default tools while keeping extension/custom tools enabled, instead of falling through to the same "disable everything" path as `--no-tools` ([#3592](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3592))
- Fixed remaining hardcoded `pi` / `.pi` branding to route through `APP_NAME` and `CONFIG_DIR_NAME` extension points, so SDK rebrands get consistent naming in `/quit` description, `process.title`, and the project-local extensions directory ([#3583](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3583) by [@jlaneve](https://github.com/jlaneve))
- Fixed `pi-coding-agent` shipping `uuid@11`, which triggered `npm audit` moderate vulnerability reports for downstream installs; the package now depends on `uuid@14` ([#3577](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3577))
- Fixed `openai-completions` streamed tool-call assembly to coalesce deltas by stable tool index when OpenAI-compatible gateways mutate tool call IDs mid-stream, preventing malformed Kimi K2.6/OpenCode tool streams from splitting one call into multiple bogus tool calls ([#3576](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3576))
- Fixed `ctx.ui.setWorkingMessage()` to persist across loader recreation, matching the behavior of `ctx.ui.setWorkingIndicator()` ([#3566](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3566))
- Fixed coding-agent `fs.watch` error handling for theme and git-footer watchers to retry after transient watcher failures such as `EMFILE`, avoiding startup crashes in large repos ([#3564](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3564))
- Fixed built-in `kimi-coding` model generation to attach the expected `User-Agent` header so direct Kimi Coding requests use the provider's expected client identity ([#3586](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3586))
- Fixed extension shortcut conflict diagnostics to display at startup instead of only on reload, so extension authors discover reserved keybinding conflicts immediately rather than discovering them later through user feedback ([#3617](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3617))
- Fixed `models.json` Anthropic-compatible provider configuration to accept `compat.supportsEagerToolInputStreaming`, allowing proxies that reject per-tool `eager_input_streaming` to use the legacy fine-grained tool streaming beta header instead ([#3575](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3575))
- Fixed startup banner extension labels to strip trailing `index.js`/`index.ts` suffixes ([#3596](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3596) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed OSC 9;4 terminal progress updates to stay alive in terminals such as Ghostty during long-running agent work ([#3610](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3610))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completion usage parsing to avoid double-counting reasoning tokens already included in `completion_tokens` ([#3581](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3581))
- Fixed `openai-responses` compatibility for strict OpenAI-compatible proxies by allowing `models.json` to disable the underscore-containing `session_id` header with `compat.sendSessionIdHeader: false` ([#3579](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3579))
- Fixed GPT-5.5 Codex capability handling to clamp unsupported minimal reasoning to `low` and apply the model's 2.5x priority service-tier pricing multiplier ([#3618](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3618) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### New Features

- TypeBox 1.x migration for extensions and SDK integrations, including TypeBox-native tool argument validation that now works in eval-restricted runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md).
- Stacked extension autocomplete providers via `ctx.ui.addAutocompleteProvider(...)`, allowing extensions to layer custom completion logic on top of built-in slash and path completion. See [docs/extensions.md#autocomplete-providers](docs/extensions.md#autocomplete-providers) and [examples/extensions/github-issue-autocomplete.ts](examples/extensions/github-issue-autocomplete.ts).
- Terminating tool results via `terminate: true`, allowing custom tools to end on a final tool call without paying for an automatic follow-up LLM turn. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/structured-output.ts](examples/extensions/structured-output.ts).
- OSC 9;4 terminal progress indicators during agent streaming and compaction for supporting terminals.

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated first-party coding-agent code, SDK/examples/docs, and package metadata from `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x to `typebox` 1.x. New extensions, SDK integrations, and pi packages should depend on and import from `typebox`. Legacy extension loading still aliases the root `@sinclair/typebox` package, but `@sinclair/typebox/compiler` is no longer shimmed. This migration also picks up the new `@mariozechner/pi-ai` TypeBox-native validator path, so tool argument validation now works in eval-restricted runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers instead of being skipped ([#3112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3112))
- Session-replacement commands now invalidate captured pre-replacement session-bound extension objects after `ctx.newSession()`, `ctx.fork()`, and `ctx.switchSession()`. Old `pi` and command `ctx` references now throw instead of silently targeting the replaced session. Migration: if code needs to keep working in the replacement session after one of those calls, pass `withSession` to that same method and do the post-switch work there. In practice, move post-switch `pi.sendUserMessage()`, `pi.sendMessage()`, and command-ctx/session-manager access into `withSession`, and use only the `ReplacedSessionContext` passed to that callback for session-bound operations. Footguns: `withSession` runs after the old extension instance has already received `session_shutdown`, old cleanup may already have invalidated captured state, captured old `pi` / old command `ctx` are stale, and previously extracted raw objects such as `const sm = ctx.sessionManager` remain the caller's responsibility and must not be reused after the switch.

### Added

- Added support for terminating tool results via `terminate: true`, allowing custom tools to end the current tool batch without an automatic follow-up LLM call, plus a `structured-output.ts` extension example and extension docs showing the pattern ([#3525](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3525))
- Added OSC 9;4 terminal progress indicators during agent streaming and compaction, so terminals like iTerm2, WezTerm, Windows Terminal, and Kitty show activity in their tab bar
- Added `ctx.ui.addAutocompleteProvider(...)` for stacking extension autocomplete providers on top of the built-in slash/path provider, plus a `github-issue-autocomplete.ts` example and extension docs ([#2983](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2983))

### Fixed

- Fixed exported session HTML to sanitize markdown link URLs before rendering them into anchor tags, blocking `javascript:`-style payloads while preserving safe links in shared/exported sessions ([#3532](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3532))
- Fixed `ctx.getSystemPrompt()` inside `before_agent_start` to reflect chained system-prompt changes made by earlier `before_agent_start` handlers, and clarified the extension docs around provider-payload rewrites and what `ctx.getSystemPrompt()` does and does not report ([#3539](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3539))
- Fixed built-in `google-gemini-cli` model lists and selector entries to include `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, so Cloud Code Assist users no longer need manual `--model` fallback selection to use it ([#3545](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3545))
- Fixed extension session-replacement flows so `ctx.newSession()`, `ctx.fork()`, `ctx.switchSession()`, and imported-session replacements fully rebind before post-switch work runs, added `withSession` replacement callbacks with fresh `ReplacedSessionContext` helpers, and make stale pre-replacement `pi` / `ctx` session-bound accesses throw instead of silently targeting the wrong session ([#2860](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2860))
- Fixed `models.json` built-in provider overrides to accept `headers` without requiring `baseUrl`, so request-header-only overrides now load and apply correctly ([#3538](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3538))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### New Features

- Fireworks provider support with built-in models and `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` auth. See [README.md#providers--models](README.md#providers--models) and [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).
- Configurable inline tool image width via `terminal.imageWidthCells` in `/settings`. See [docs/settings.md#terminal--images](docs/settings.md#terminal--images).

### Added

- Added built-in Fireworks provider support, including `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` setup/docs and the default Fireworks model `accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p6` ([#3519](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3519))

### Fixed

- Fixed interactive inline tool images to honor configurable `terminal.imageWidthCells` via `/settings`, so tool-output images are no longer hard-capped to 60 terminal cells ([#3508](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3508))
- Fixed `sessionDir` in `settings.json` to expand `~`, so portable session-directory settings no longer require a shell wrapper ([#3514](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3514))
- Fixed parallel tool-call rows to leave the pending state as soon as each tool is finalized, while still appending persisted tool results in assistant source order ([#3503](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3503))
- Fixed exported session markdown to render Markdown while showing HTML-like message content such as `<file name="...">...</file>` verbatim, so shared sessions match the TUI instead of letting the browser interpret message text ([#3484](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3484))
- Fixed exported session HTML to render `grep` and `find` output through their existing TUI renderers and `ls` output through a native template renderer, avoiding missing formatting and spacing artifacts in shared sessions ([#3491](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3491) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy search to follow symlinked directories and include symlinked paths in results ([#3507](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3507))
- Fixed proxied agent streams to preserve the proxy-safe serializable subset of stream options, including session, transport, retry-delay, metadata, header, cache-retention, and thinking-budget settings ([#3512](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3512))
- Hardened Anthropic streaming against malformed tool-call JSON by owning SSE parsing with defensive JSON repair, replacing the deprecated `fine-grained-tool-streaming` beta header with per-tool `eager_input_streaming`, and updating stale test model references ([#3175](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3175))
- Fixed Bedrock runtime endpoint resolution to stop pinning built-in regional endpoints over `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_PROFILE`, restoring `us.*` and `eu.*` inference profile support after v0.68.0 while preserving custom VPC/proxy endpoint overrides ([#3481](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3481), [#3485](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3485), [#3486](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3486), [#3487](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3487), [#3488](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3488))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### New Features

- Configurable streaming working indicator for extensions via `ctx.ui.setWorkingIndicator()`, including animated, static, and hidden indicators. See [docs/tui.md#working-indicator](docs/tui.md#working-indicator), [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md), and [examples/extensions/working-indicator.ts](examples/extensions/working-indicator.ts).
- `before_agent_start` now exposes `systemPromptOptions` (`BuildSystemPromptOptions`) so extensions can inspect the structured system-prompt inputs without re-discovering resources. See [docs/extensions.md#before_agent_start](docs/extensions.md#before_agent_start) and [examples/extensions/prompt-customizer.ts](examples/extensions/prompt-customizer.ts).
- Configurable keybindings for scoped model selector actions and session-tree filter actions. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).
- `/clone` duplicates the current active branch into a new session, while extensions can choose whether to fork `before` or `at` an entry via `ctx.fork(..., { position })`. See [README.md](README.md), [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md), and [docs/session.md](docs/session.md).

### Breaking Changes

- Changed SDK and CLI tool selection from cwd-bound built-in tool instances to tool-name allowlists. `createAgentSession({ tools })` now expects `string[]` names such as `"read"` and `"bash"` instead of `Tool[]`, `--tools` now allowlists built-in, extension, and custom tools by name, and `--no-tools` now disables all tools by default rather than only built-ins. Migrate SDK code from `tools: [readTool, bashTool]` to `tools: ["read", "bash"]` ([#2835](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2835), [#3452](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3452))
- Removed prebuilt cwd-bound tool and tool-definition exports from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, including `readTool`, `bashTool`, `editTool`, `writeTool`, `grepTool`, `findTool`, `lsTool`, `readOnlyTools`, `codingTools`, and the corresponding `*ToolDefinition` values. Use the explicit factory exports instead, for example `createReadTool(cwd)`, `createBashTool(cwd)`, `createCodingTools(cwd)`, and `createReadToolDefinition(cwd)` ([#3452](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3452))
- Removed ambient `process.cwd()` / default agent-dir fallback behavior from public resource helpers. `DefaultResourceLoader`, `loadProjectContextFiles()`, and `loadSkills()` now require explicit cwd/agent-dir style inputs, and exported system-prompt option types now require an explicit `cwd`. Pass the session or project cwd explicitly instead of relying on process-global defaults ([#3452](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3452))

### Added

- Added extension support for customizing the interactive streaming working indicator via `ctx.ui.setWorkingIndicator()`, including custom animated frames, static indicators, hidden indicators, a new `working-indicator.ts` example extension, and updated extension/TUI/RPC docs ([#3413](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3413))
- Added `systemPromptOptions` (`BuildSystemPromptOptions`) to `before_agent_start` extension events, so extensions can inspect the structured inputs used to build the current system prompt ([#3473](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3473) by [@dljsjr](https://github.com/dljsjr))
- Added `/clone` to duplicate the current active branch into a new session, while keeping `/fork` focused on forking from a previous user message ([#2962](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2962))
- Added `ctx.fork()` support for `position: "before" | "at"` so extensions and integrations can branch before a user message or duplicate the current point in the conversation; the interactive clone/fork UX builds on that runtime support ([#3431](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3431) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Added configurable keybinding ids for scoped model selector actions and tree filter actions, so those interactive shortcuts can be remapped in `keybindings.json` ([#3343](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3343) by [@mpazik](https://github.com/mpazik))
- Added `PI_OAUTH_CALLBACK_HOST` support for built-in OAuth login flows, allowing local callback servers used by `pi auth` to bind to a custom interface instead of hardcoded `127.0.0.1` ([#3409](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3409) by [@Michaelliv](https://github.com/Michaelliv))
- Added `reason` and `targetSessionFile` metadata to `session_shutdown` extension events, so extensions can distinguish quit, reload, new-session, resume, and fork teardown paths ([#2863](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2863))

### Changed

- Changed `pi update` to batch npm package updates per scope and run git package updates with bounded parallelism, reducing multi-package update time while preserving skip behavior for pinned and already-current packages ([#2980](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2980))
- Changed Bedrock session requests to omit `maxTokens` when model token limits are unknown and to omit `temperature` when unset, letting Bedrock use provider defaults and avoid unnecessary TPM quota reservation ([#3400](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3400) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))

### Fixed

- Fixed `AgentSession` system-prompt option initialization to avoid constructing an invalid empty `BuildSystemPromptOptions`, so `npm run check` passes after `cwd` became mandatory.
- Fixed shell-path resolution to stop consulting ambient `process.cwd()` state during bash execution, so session/project-specific `shellPath` settings now follow the active coding-agent session cwd instead of the launcher cwd ([#3452](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3452))
- Fixed `ctx.ui.setWorkingIndicator()` custom frames to render verbatim instead of forcing the theme accent color, so extensions now own working-indicator coloring when they customize it ([#3467](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3467))
- Fixed `pi update` reinstalling npm packages that are already at the latest published version by checking the installed package version before running `npm install <pkg>@latest` ([#3000](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3000))
- Fixed `@` autocomplete plain queries to stop matching against the full cwd/base path, so path fragments in worktree names no longer crowd out intended results such as `@plan` ([#2778](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2778))
- Fixed built-in tool wrapping to use the same extension-runner context path as extension tools, so built-in tools receive execution context and `read` can warn when the current model does not support images ([#3429](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3429))
- Fixed `openai-completions` assistant replay to preserve `compat.requiresThinkingAsText` text-part serialization, avoiding same-model follow-up crashes when previous assistant messages mix thinking and text ([#3387](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3387))
- Fixed direct OpenAI Chat Completions sessions to map `sessionId` and `cacheRetention` to prompt caching fields, sending `prompt_cache_key` when caching is enabled and `prompt_cache_retention: "24h"` for direct `api.openai.com` requests with long retention ([#3426](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3426))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions sessions to optionally send aligned `session_id`, `x-client-request-id`, and `x-session-affinity` headers from `sessionId` via `compat.sendSessionAffinityHeaders`, improving cache-affinity routing for backends such as Fireworks ([#3430](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3430))
- Fixed threaded `/resume` session relationships and current-session detection to canonicalize symlinked session paths during selector comparisons, so shared session directories no longer break parent-child matching or active-session delete protection ([#3364](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3364))
- Fixed `/session`, Sessions docs, and CLI help to consistently document that session reuse supports both file paths and session IDs, and that `/session` shows the current session ID ([#3390](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3390))
- Fixed Windows pnpm global install detection to recognize `\\.pnpm\\` store paths, so update notices now suggest `pnpm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` instead of falling back to npm ([#3378](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3378))
- Fixed missing `@sinclair/typebox` runtime dependency in `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, so strict pnpm installs no longer fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when starting `pi` ([#3434](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3434))
- Fixed xterm uppercase typing in the interactive editor by decoding printable `modifyOtherKeys` input and normalizing shifted letter matching, so `Shift+letter` no longer disappears in `pi` ([#3436](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3436))
- Fixed `/compact` to reuse the session thinking level for compaction summaries instead of forcing `high`, avoiding invalid reasoning-effort errors on `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.7` sessions configured for `medium` thinking ([#3438](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3438))
- Fixed shared/exported plain-text tool output to preserve indentation instead of collapsing leading whitespace in the web share page ([#3440](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3440))
- Fixed exported share pages to use browser-safe `T` and `O` shortcuts with clickable header toggles for thinking and tool visibility instead of browser-reserved `Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+O` bindings ([#3374](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3374) by [@vekexasia](https://github.com/vekexasia))
- Fixed skill resolution to dedupe symlinked aliases by canonical path, so `pi config` no longer shows duplicate skill entries when `~/.pi/agent/skills` points to `~/.agents/skills` ([#3417](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3417) by [@rwachtler](https://github.com/rwachtler))
- Fixed OpenRouter request attribution to include Pi app headers (`HTTP-Referer: https://pi.dev`, `X-OpenRouter-Title: pi`, `X-OpenRouter-Categories: cli-agent`) when sessions are created through the coding-agent SDK and install telemetry is enabled ([#3414](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3414))
- Fixed custom-model `compat` schema/docs to support `cacheControlFormat: "anthropic"` for OpenAI-compatible providers that expose Anthropic-style prompt caching via `cache_control` markers ([#3392](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3392))
- Fixed Cloud Code Assist tool schemas to strip JSON Schema meta-declaration keys before provider translation, avoiding validation failures for tool-enabled sessions that use `$schema`, `$defs`, and related metadata ([#3412](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3412) by [@vladlearns](https://github.com/vladlearns))
- Fixed direct Bedrock sessions to honor `model.baseUrl` as the runtime client endpoint, restoring support for custom Bedrock VPC or proxy routes ([#3402](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3402) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))
- Fixed the `edit` tool to coerce stringified `edits` JSON before validation, so models that send the array payload as a JSON string no longer fall back to ad-hoc shell edits ([#3370](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3370) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Fixed package manifest positive glob entries to expand before loading packaged resources, restoring manifest patterns such as `skills/**/*.md` ([#3350](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3350) by [@neonspectra](https://github.com/neonspectra))

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

### New Features

- Bedrock sessions can now authenticate with `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, enabling Converse API access without local SigV4 credentials. See [docs/providers.md#amazon-bedrock](docs/providers.md#amazon-bedrock).

### Added

- Added Bedrock bearer-token authentication support via `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, enabling coding-agent sessions to use Bedrock Converse without local SigV4 credentials ([#3125](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3125) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))

### Fixed

- Fixed `/scoped-models` Alt+Up/Down to stay a no-op in the implicit `all enabled` state instead of materializing a full explicit enabled-model list and marking the selector dirty ([#3331](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3331))
- Fixed Mistral Small 4 default thinking requests to use the model's supported reasoning control, avoiding `400` errors when starting sessions on `mistral-small-2603` and `mistral-small-latest` ([#3338](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3338))
- Fixed Qwen chat-template thinking replay to preserve prior thinking across turns, so affected OpenAI-compatible models keep multi-turn tool-call arguments instead of degrading to empty `{}` payloads ([#3325](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3325))
- Fixed exported HTML transcripts so text selection no longer triggers click-based expand/collapse toggles ([#3332](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3332) by [@xu0o0](https://github.com/xu0o0))
- Fixed flaky git package update notifications by waiting for captured git command stdio to fully drain before comparing local and remote commit SHAs ([#3027](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3027))
- Fixed system prompt dates to use a stable `YYYY-MM-DD` format instead of locale-dependent output, keeping prompts deterministic across runtimes and locales ([#2814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2814))
- Fixed auto-retry transient error detection to treat `Network connection lost.` as retryable, so dropped provider connections retry instead of terminating the agent ([#3317](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3317))
- Fixed compact interactive extension startup summaries to disambiguate package extensions and repeated local `index.ts` entries by using package-aware labels and the minimal parent path needed to make local entries unique ([#3308](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3308))
- Fixed git package dependency installation to use production installs (`npm install --omit=dev`) during both install and update flows, so extension runtime dependencies must come from `dependencies` and not `devDependencies` ([#3009](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3009))
- Fixed `tool_result` / `afterToolCall` extension handling for error results by forwarding `details` and `isError` overrides through `AgentSession` instead of dropping them when `isError` was already true ([#3051](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3051))
- Fixed missing root exports for `RpcClient` and RPC protocol types from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, so ESM consumers can import them from the main package entrypoint ([#3275](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3275))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex service-tier cost accounting to trust the explicitly requested tier when the API echoes the default tier in responses, keeping session cost displays aligned with the selected tier ([#3307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3307) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed parallel tool-call finalization to convert `afterToolCall` hook throws into error tool results instead of aborting the remaining tool batch ([#3084](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3084))
- Fixed Bun binary asset path resolution to honor `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` for built-in themes, HTML export templates, and interactive bundled assets ([#3074](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3074))
- Fixed user-message turn spacing in interactive mode by restoring an inter-message spacer before user turns (except the first user message), preventing assistant and user blocks from rendering flush together.
- Fixed interactive `/import` handling to support quoted JSONL paths with spaces, route missing JSONL files through the non-fatal `SessionImportFileNotFoundError` path, and document the `importFromJsonl()` exceptions (`SessionImportFileNotFoundError`, `MissingSessionCwdError`).

## [0.67.6] - 2026-04-16

### New Features

- Prompt templates support an `argument-hint` frontmatter field that renders before the description in the `/` autocomplete dropdown, using `<angle>` for required and `[square]` for optional arguments. See [docs/prompt-templates.md#argument-hints](docs/prompt-templates.md#argument-hints).
- New `after_provider_response` extension hook lets extensions inspect provider HTTP status codes and headers immediately after each response is received and before stream consumption begins. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- Compact interactive startup header with a comma-separated view of loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions. Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle the expanded listing.
- Markdown links in assistant output now render as OSC 8 hyperlinks on terminals that advertise support; unknown terminals and tmux/screen default to plain text so URLs are never silently dropped.

### Added

- Added `argument-hint` frontmatter field for prompt templates, displayed before the description in the autocomplete dropdown ([#2780](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2780) by [@andresvi94](https://github.com/andresvi94))
- Added `after_provider_response` extension hook so extensions can inspect provider HTTP status codes and headers after each provider response is received and before stream consumption begins ([#3128](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3128))
- Added OSC 8 hyperlink rendering for markdown links when the terminal advertises support ([#3248](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3248) by [@ofa1](https://github.com/ofa1))

### Changed

- Changed interactive startup header to a compact, comma-separated view of loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions, with `Ctrl+O` to toggle the expanded listing ([#3267](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3267))
- Tightened hyperlink capability detection to default `hyperlinks: false` for unknown terminals and force it off under tmux/screen (including nested sessions), preventing markdown link URLs from disappearing on terminals that silently swallow OSC 8 sequences ([#3248](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3248))

### Fixed

- Fixed interactive user message rendering to keep bottom padding visible in terminals affected by OSC 133 prompt markers without adding an extra blank line before the following assistant message ([#3090](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3090))
- Fixed `--verbose` startup output to begin with expanded startup help and loaded resource listings after the compact startup header change ([#3147](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3147))
- Fixed `find` tool returning no results for path-based glob patterns such as `src/**/*.spec.ts` or `some/parent/child/**` by switching fd into full-path mode and normalizing the pattern when it contains a `/` ([#3302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3302))
- Fixed `find` tool applying nested `.gitignore` rules across sibling directories (e.g. rules from `a/.gitignore` hiding matching files under `b/`) by dropping the manual `--ignore-file` collection and delegating to fd's hierarchical `.gitignore` handling via `--no-require-git` ([#3303](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3303))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses prompt caching for non-`api.openai.com` base URLs (OpenAI-compatible proxies such as litellm, theclawbay) by sending the `session_id` and `x-client-request-id` cache-affinity headers unconditionally when a `sessionId` is provided, matching the official Codex CLI behavior ([#3264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3264) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti))
- Fixed the `preset` example extension to snapshot the active model, thinking level, and tool set on the first preset application and restore that state when cycling back to `(none)`, instead of falling back to a hardcoded default tool list ([#3272](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3272) by [@stembi](https://github.com/stembi))

## [0.67.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Opus 4.7 adaptive thinking configuration across Anthropic and Bedrock providers by recognizing Opus 4.7 adaptive-thinking support and mapping `xhigh` reasoning to provider-supported effort values ([#3286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3286) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed Zellij `Shift+Enter` regressions by reverting the Zellij-specific Kitty keyboard query bypass and restoring the previous keyboard negotiation behavior ([#3259](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3259))

## [0.67.4] - 2026-04-16

### New Features

- `--no-context-files` (`-nc`) disables automatic `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` discovery when you need a clean run without project context injection. See [README.md#context-files](README.md#context-files).
- `loadProjectContextFiles()` is now exported as a standalone utility for extensions and SDK-style integrations that need to inspect the same context-file resolution order used by the CLI. See [README.md#context-files](README.md#context-files).
- New `after_provider_response` extension hook lets extensions inspect provider HTTP status codes and headers immediately after response creation and before stream consumption. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).

### Added

- Added `--no-context-files` (`-nc`) to disable `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` context file discovery and loading ([#3253](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3253))
- Exported `loadProjectContextFiles()` as a standalone utility so extensions can discover project context files without instantiating a full `DefaultResourceLoader` ([#3142](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3142))
- Added `after_provider_response` extension hook so extensions can inspect provider HTTP status codes and headers after each provider response is received and before stream consumption begins ([#3128](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3128))

### Changed

- Added `claude-opus-4-7` model for Anthropic.
- Changed Anthropic prompt caching to add a `cache_control` breakpoint on the last tool definition, so tool schemas can be cached independently from transcript updates while preserving existing cache retention behavior ([#3260](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3260))

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown strikethrough parsing in interactive rendering and HTML export to require strict double-tilde delimiters (`~~text~~`) with non-whitespace boundaries.
- Fixed shutdown handling to kill tracked detached `bash` tool child processes on exit signals, preventing orphaned background processes.
- Fixed flaky `edit-tool-no-full-redraw` TUI tests by waiting for asynchronous preview and preflight error rendering instead of relying on fixed render ticks.
- Fixed `kimi-coding` default model selection to use `kimi-for-coding` instead of `kimi-k2-thinking` ([#3242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3242))
- Fixed `ctrl+z` on native Windows to avoid crashing interactive mode, disable the default suspend binding there, and show a status message when suspend is invoked manually ([#3191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3191))
- Fixed `find` tool cancellation and responsiveness on broad searches by making `.gitignore` discovery and `fd` execution fully abort-aware and non-blocking ([#3148](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3148))
- Fixed `grep` broad-search stalls when `context=0` by formatting match lines from ripgrep JSON output instead of doing synchronous per-match file reads ([#3205](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3205))

## [0.67.3] - 2026-04-15

### New Features

- `renderShell: "self"` for custom and built-in tool renderers so tools can own their outer shell instead of the default boxed shell. Useful for stable large previews such as edit diffs. See [docs/extensions.md#custom-rendering](docs/extensions.md#custom-rendering).
- Interactive auto-retry status now shows a live countdown during backoff instead of a static retry delay message.

### Added

- Added `renderShell: "self"` for custom and built-in tool renderers so tools can own their outer shell instead of using the default boxed shell. This is useful for stable large previews such as edit diffs ([#3134](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3134))

### Fixed

- Fixed edit diff previews to stay visible during edit permission dialogs and session replay without reintroducing large-result redraw flicker ([#3134](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3134))
- Fixed `/reload` to render a static reload status box instead of an animated spinner, avoiding redraw instability during interactive reloads.
- Fixed the `plan-mode` example extension to allow `eza` in the read-only bash allowlist instead of the deprecated `exa` command ([#3240](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3240) by [@rwachtler](https://github.com/rwachtler))
- Fixed `google-vertex` API key resolution to treat `gcp-vertex-credentials` as an Application Default Credentials marker instead of a literal API key, so marker-based setups correctly fall back to ADC ([#3221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3221) by [@deepkilo](https://github.com/deepkilo))
- Fixed RPC `prompt` to wait for prompt preflight success before emitting its single authoritative response, while still treating handled and queued prompts as success ([#3049](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3049))
- Fixed `/scoped-models` reordering to propagate into the `/model` scoped tab, preserving the user-defined scoped model order instead of re-sorting it ([#3217](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3217))
- Fixed `session_shutdown` to fire on `SIGHUP` and `SIGTERM` in interactive, print, and RPC modes so extensions can run shutdown cleanup on those signal-driven exits ([#3212](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3212))
- Fixed screenshot path parsing to handle lower case am/pm in macOS screenshot filenames ([#3194](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3194) by [@jay-aye-see-kay](https://github.com/jay-aye-see-kay))
- Fixed interactive auto-retry status updates to show a live countdown during backoff instead of a static retry delay message ([#3187](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3187))

## [0.67.2] - 2026-04-14

### New Features

- Support for multiple `--append-system-prompt` flags, each value is appended to the system prompt separated by double newlines. See [README.md#other-options](README.md#other-options).
- Support for passing inline extension factories to `main()` for embedded integrations and custom entrypoints.
- Interactive keybinding support for Kitty `super`-modified shortcuts such as `super+k`, `super+enter`, and `ctrl+super+k`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Added

- Added support for multiple `--append-system-prompt` flags, each value is appended to the system prompt separated by double newlines ([#3171](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3171) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Added interactive keybinding support for Kitty `super`-modified shortcuts such as `super+k`, `super+enter`, and `ctrl+super+k` ([#3111](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3111) by [@sudosubin](https://github.com/sudosubin))
- Added support for passing inline extension factories to `main()` for embedded integrations and custom entrypoints ([#3099](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3099) by [@pmateusz](https://github.com/pmateusz))

### Fixed

- Fixed direct OpenAI Responses and Codex SSE requests to align `prompt_cache_key`, `session_id`, and `x-client-request-id` values with the same session-derived identifier, improving prompt cache affinity for append-only sessions ([#3018](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3018) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))
- Fixed streaming-only `partialJson` scratch buffers leaking into persisted OpenAI Responses tool calls, which could corrupt follow-up payloads on resumed conversations.
- Fixed Ctrl+Alt letter key matching in tmux by falling through from legacy ESC-prefixed handling to CSI-u and xterm `modifyOtherKeys` parsing when the legacy form does not match ([#2989](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2989) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))
- Fixed the shipped `subagent` example to avoid leaking Bun virtual filesystem script paths into subagent prompts ([#3002](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3002) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))
- Fixed bordered loaders to stop their animation timer when disposed, preventing stale loader updates after teardown.

## [0.67.1] - 2026-04-13

### Telemetry

Interactive mode now sends a lightweight anonymous install/update telemetry ping to `https://pi.dev/install?version=x.y.z` after it writes `lastChangelogVersion` in `settings.json`.

Why this exists:
- Pi needs a reliable per-version usage signal to understand whether releases are being adopted and to help justify funding continued development.
- npm download counts are not a reliable proxy for actual Pi usage.

How it works:
- It only runs in interactive mode.
- It does not run in RPC mode, print mode, JSON mode, or SDK mode.
- On a fresh interactive install, Pi writes `lastChangelogVersion`, then sends the ping.
- On later interactive startups, if the local changelog contains entries newer than the previously stored `lastChangelogVersion`, Pi writes the new `lastChangelogVersion`, then sends the ping.
- The request is fire-and-forget. Startup does not wait for it, and any errors are ignored.

What data is collected:
- Only the Pi version in the request path, for example `https://pi.dev/install?version=0.67.1`.
- The server stores only aggregate per-version counters such as `{ "0.67.1": 3 }`.
- It does not store IP addresses, client identifiers, prompts, paths, models, auth state, or any other per-user data. It literally only increments a counter for that version.

How to disable it:
- `/settings` → disable `Install telemetry`
- `settings.json` → set `enableInstallTelemetry` to `false`
- `PI_OFFLINE=1`
- `PI_TELEMETRY=0`

### New Features

- Full `openRouterRouting` support in `models.json`, including fallbacks, parameter requirements, data collection, ZDR, ignore lists, quantizations, provider sorting, max price, and preferred throughput and latency constraints. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md).
- `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` environment variable set at startup so subprocesses can detect they are running inside the coding agent.
- Updated `antigravity-image-gen.ts` example extension to use User-Agent version `1.21.9` ([#2901](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2901) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed `--list-models` silently swallowing `models.json` load errors; errors are now printed to stderr ([#3072](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3072))
- Fixed custom models for built-in providers (e.g. `openrouter`) being silently dropped from `--list-models` by inheriting `api`/`baseUrl` from built-in model definitions and no longer requiring `apiKey` for providers with existing auth ([#2921](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2921) and [#3072](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3072))

### Added

- Added full `openRouterRouting` field support in `models.json`, including fallbacks, parameter requirements, data collection, ZDR, ignore lists, quantizations, provider sorting, max price, and preferred throughput and latency constraints ([#2904](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2904) by [@zmberber](https://github.com/zmberber))
- Set `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` environment variable at startup so sub-processes can detect they are running inside the coding agent ([#2868](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2868))

### Fixed

- Fixed interactive changelog rendering for the telemetry notes by moving the section under a `### Telemetry` heading, so startup shows the full release notes instead of only the version header.
- Updated `antigravity-image-gen.ts` example extension to use User-Agent version `1.21.9` ([#2901](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2901) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Bumped default Antigravity User-Agent version to `1.21.9` ([#2901](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2901) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed Gemma 4 thinking level mapping to route between `MINIMAL` and `HIGH`, and map Pi reasoning levels to the model's supported thinking levels ([#2903](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2903) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite minimal thinking budget to use the model's supported 512-token minimum instead of the regular Flash 128-token minimum, avoiding invalid thinking budget errors ([#2861](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2861) by [@JasonOA888](https://github.com/JasonOA888))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses requests to forward configured `serviceTier` values, restoring service-tier selection for Codex sessions ([#2996](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2996) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed newly generated session IDs to use UUIDv7, improving time locality for session-based request routing ([#3018](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3018) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))
- Fixed `Container.render()` stack overflow on long sessions by replacing `Array.push(...spread)` with a loop-based push, preventing `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` when child output exceeds the V8 call stack argument limit ([#2651](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2651))
- Fixed editor sticky-column tracking around paste markers so vertical cursor navigation restores the column from before the cursor entered a paste marker instead of jumping inside or past pasted content ([#3092](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3092) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed queued messages typed during `/tree` branch summarization to flush automatically after navigation completes, so they no longer remain stuck in the steering queue ([#3091](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3091) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed npm package update check to work with packages on non-default registries by using `npm view` instead of hardcoded `registry.npmjs.org` fetch ([#3164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3164) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.67.0] - 2026-04-13

See [0.67.1]. Version 0.67.0 shipped with a changelog formatting error that caused interactive startup to show only the version header instead of the full release notes.

## [0.66.1] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Changed the Earendil announcement from an automatic startup notice to the hidden `/dementedelves` slash command.

## [0.66.0] - 2026-04-08

### New Features

- Earendil startup announcement with bundled inline image rendering and a linked blog post for April 8 and 9, 2026.
- Interactive Anthropic subscription auth warning when Anthropic subscription auth is active, clarifying that Anthropic third-party usage draws from extra usage and is billed per token.

### Fixed

- Fixed bare `readline` import to use `node:readline` prefix for Deno compatibility ([#2885](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2885) by [@milosv-vtool](https://github.com/milosv-vtool))
- Fixed auto-retry to treat stream failures like `request ended without sending any chunks` as transient errors ([#2892](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2892))
- Fixed interactive startup notices to render after the initial resource listing, and added a bundled Earendil startup announcement with inline image rendering for April 8 and 9, 2026. Moved the blog link above the image to avoid overlap with terminal image rendering.
- Fixed interactive mode to warn when Anthropic subscription auth is active, so users know Anthropic third-party usage draws from extra usage and is billed per token.

## [0.65.2] - 2026-04-06

## [0.65.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Fixed bash output truncation by line count to always persist full output to a temp file, preventing data loss when output exceeds 2000 lines but stays under the byte threshold ([#2852](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2852))
- RpcClient now forwards subprocess stderr to parent process in real-time ([#2805](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2805))
- Theme file watcher now handles async `fs.watch` error events instead of crashing the process ([#2791](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2791))
- Fixed stored session cwd handling so resuming or importing a session whose original working directory no longer exists now prompts interactive users to continue in the current cwd, while non-interactive modes fail with a clear error.
- Fixed resource collision precedence so project and user skills, prompt templates, and themes override package resources consistently, and CLI-provided paths take precedence over discovered resources ([#2781](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2781))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions streaming usage accounting to preserve `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` and normalize OpenRouter `cached_tokens`, preventing incorrect cache read/write token and cost reporting in pi ([#2802](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2802))
- Fixed CLI extension paths like `git:gist.github.com/...` being incorrectly resolved against cwd instead of being passed through to the package manager ([#2845](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2845) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed piped stdin runs with `--mode json` to preserve JSONL output instead of falling back to plain text ([#2848](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2848) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed interactive command docs to stop listing removed `/exit` as a supported quit command ([#2850](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2850))

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### New Features

- **Session runtime API**: `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime` provide a closure-based runtime that recreates cwd-bound services and session config on every session switch. Startup, `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, and import all use the same creation path. See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/13-session-runtime.ts](examples/sdk/13-session-runtime.ts).
- **Label timestamps in `/tree`**: Toggle timestamps on tree entries with `Shift+T`, with smart date formatting and timestamp preservation through branching ([#2691](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2691) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))
- **`defineTool()` helper**: Create standalone custom tool definitions with full TypeScript parameter type inference, no manual casts needed ([#2746](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2746)). See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- **Unified diagnostics**: Arg parsing, service creation, session option resolution, and resource loading all return structured diagnostics (`info`/`warning`/`error`) instead of logging or exiting. The app layer decides presentation and exit behavior.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed extension post-transition events `session_switch` and `session_fork`. Use `session_start` with `event.reason` (`"startup" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork"`). For `"new"`, `"resume"`, and `"fork"`, `session_start` includes `previousSessionFile`.
- Removed session-replacement methods from `AgentSession`. Use `AgentSessionRuntime` for `newSession()`, `switchSession()`, `fork()`, and `importFromJsonl()`. Cross-cwd session replacement rebuilds all cwd-bound runtime state and replaces the live `AgentSession` instance.
- Removed `session_directory` from extension and settings APIs.
- Unknown single-dash CLI flags (e.g. `-s`) now produce an error instead of being silently ignored.

#### Migration: Extensions

Before:

```ts
pi.on("session_switch", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
pi.on("session_fork", async (_event, ctx) => { ... });
```

After:

```ts
pi.on("session_start", async (event, ctx) => {
  // event.reason: "startup" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork"
  // event.previousSessionFile: set for "new", "resume", "fork"
});
```

#### Migration: SDK session replacement

Before:

```ts
await session.newSession();
await session.switchSession("/path/to/session.jsonl");
```

After:

```ts
import {
  type CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory,
  createAgentSessionFromServices,
  createAgentSessionRuntime,
  createAgentSessionServices,
  getAgentDir,
  SessionManager,
} from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";

const createRuntime: CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory = async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
  const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
  return {
    ...(await createAgentSessionFromServices({ services, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent })),
    services,
    diagnostics: services.diagnostics,
  };
};

const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});

await runtime.newSession();
await runtime.switchSession("/path/to/session.jsonl");
await runtime.fork("entry-id");

// After replacement, runtime.session is the new live session.
// Rebind any session-local subscriptions or extension bindings.
```

### Added

- Added `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime` for runtime-backed session replacement. The runtime takes a `CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory` closure that closes over process-global fixed inputs and recreates cwd-bound services and session config for each effective cwd. Startup and later `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, import all use the same factory.
- Added unified diagnostics model (`info`/`warning`/`error`) for arg parsing, service creation, session option resolution, and resource loading. Creation logic no longer logs or exits. The app layer decides presentation and exit behavior.
- Added error diagnostics for missing explicit CLI resource paths (`-e`, `--skill`, `--prompt-template`, `--theme`)

- Added `defineTool()` so standalone and array-based custom tool definitions keep inferred parameter types without manual casts ([#2746](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2746))

- Added label timestamps to the session tree with a `Shift+T` toggle in `/tree`, smart date formatting, and timestamp preservation through branching ([#2691](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2691) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))

### Fixed

- Fixed startup resource loading to reuse the initial `ResourceLoader` for the first runtime, so extensions are not loaded twice before session startup and `session_start` handlers still fire for singleton-style extensions ([#2766](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2766))
- Fixed retry settlement so retried agent runs wait for the full retry cycle to complete before declaring idle, preventing stale state after transient errors
- Fixed theme `export` colors to resolve theme variables the same way as `colors`, so `/export` HTML backgrounds now honor entries like `pageBg: "base"` instead of requiring inline hex values ([#2707](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2707))
- Fixed Bedrock throttling errors being misidentified as context overflow, causing unnecessary compaction instead of retry ([#2699](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2699) by [@xu0o0](https://github.com/xu0o0))
- Added tool streaming support for newer Z.ai models ([#2732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2732) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### New Features

- Extensions and SDK callers can attach a `prepareArguments` hook to any tool definition, letting them normalize or migrate raw model arguments before schema validation. The built-in `edit` tool uses this to transparently support sessions created with the old single-edit schema. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md)
- Extensions can customize the collapsed thinking block label via `ctx.ui.setHiddenThinkingLabel()`. See [examples/extensions/hidden-thinking-label.ts](examples/extensions/hidden-thinking-label.ts) ([#2673](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2673))

### Breaking Changes

- `ModelRegistry` no longer has a public constructor. SDK callers and tests must use `ModelRegistry.create(authStorage, modelsJsonPath?)` for file-backed registries or `ModelRegistry.inMemory(authStorage)` for built-in-only registries. Direct `new ModelRegistry(...)` calls no longer compile.

### Added

- Added `ToolDefinition.prepareArguments` hook to prepare raw tool call arguments before schema validation, enabling compatibility shims for resumed sessions with outdated tool schemas
- Built-in `edit` tool now uses `prepareArguments` to silently fold legacy top-level `oldText`/`newText` into `edits[]` when resuming old sessions
- Added `ctx.ui.setHiddenThinkingLabel()` so extensions can customize the collapsed thinking label in interactive mode, with a no-op in RPC mode and a runnable example extension in `examples/extensions/hidden-thinking-label.ts` ([#2673](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2673))

### Fixed

- Fixed extension-queued user messages to refresh the interactive pending-message list so messages submitted while a turn is active are no longer silently dropped ([#2674](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2674) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))
- Fixed monorepo `tsconfig.json` path mappings to resolve `@mariozechner/pi-ai` subpath exports to source files in development checkouts ([#2625](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2625) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Fixed TUI cell size response handling to consume only exact `CSI 6 ; height ; width t` replies, so bare `Escape` is no longer swallowed while waiting for terminal image metadata ([#2661](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2661))
- Fixed Kitty keyboard protocol keypad functional keys to normalize to logical digits, symbols, and navigation keys, so numpad input in terminals such as iTerm2 no longer inserts Private Use Area gibberish or gets ignored ([#2650](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2650))

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

### New Features

- Extension handlers can now use `ctx.signal` to forward cancellation into nested model calls, `fetch()`, and other abort-aware work. See [docs/extensions.md#ctxsignal](docs/extensions.md#ctxsignal) ([#2660](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2660))
- Built-in `edit` tool input now uses `edits[]` as the only replacement shape, reducing invalid tool calls caused by mixed single-edit and multi-edit schemas ([#2639](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2639))
- Large multi-edit results no longer trigger full-screen redraws in the interactive TUI when the final diff is rendered ([#2664](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2664))

### Added

- Added `ctx.signal` to `ExtensionContext` and wired it to the active agent turn so extension handlers can forward cancellation into nested model calls, `fetch()`, and other abort-aware work ([#2660](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2660))

### Fixed

- Fixed built-in `edit` tool input to use `edits[]` as the only replacement shape, eliminating the mixed single-edit and multi-edit modes that caused repeated invalid tool calls and retries ([#2639](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2639))
- Fixed edit tool TUI rendering to defer large multi-edit diffs to the settled result, avoiding full-screen redraws when the tool completes ([#2664](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2664))

## [0.63.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Added `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` model availability for the `google-vertex` provider ([#2610](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2610) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc))

### Fixed

- Documented `tool_call` input mutation as supported extension API behavior, clarified that post-mutation inputs are not re-validated, and added regression coverage for executing mutated tool arguments ([#2611](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2611))
- Fixed repeated compactions dropping messages that were kept by an earlier compaction by re-summarizing from the previous kept boundary and recalculating `tokensBefore` from the rebuilt session context ([#2608](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2608))
- Fixed interactive compaction UI updates so `ctx.compact()` rebuilds the chat through unified compaction events, manual compaction no longer duplicates the summary block, and the `trigger-compact` example only fires when context usage crosses its threshold ([#2617](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2617))
- Fixed interactive compaction completion to append a synthetic compaction summary after rebuilding the chat so the latest compaction remains visible at the bottom
- Fixed skill discovery to stop recursing once a directory contains `SKILL.md`, and to ignore root `*.md` files in `.agents/skills` while keeping root markdown skill files supported in `~/.pi/agent/skills`, `.pi/skills`, and package `skills/` directories ([#2603](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2603))
- Fixed edit tool diff rendering for multi-edit operations with large unchanged gaps so distant edits collapse intermediate context instead of dumping the full unchanged middle block
- Fixed edit tool error rendering to avoid repeating the same exact-match failure in both the preview and result blocks
- Fixed auto-compaction overflow recovery for Ollama models when the backend returns explicit `prompt too long; exceeded max context length ...` errors instead of silently truncating input ([#2626](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2626))
- Fixed built-in tool overrides that reuse built-in parameter schemas to still honor custom `renderCall` and `renderResult` renderers in the interactive TUI, restoring the `minimal-mode` example ([#2595](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2595))

## [0.63.0] - 2026-03-27

### Breaking Changes

- `ModelRegistry.getApiKey(model)` has been replaced by `getApiKeyAndHeaders(model)` because `models.json` auth and header values can now resolve dynamically on every request. Extensions and SDK integrations that previously fetched only an API key must now fetch request auth per call and forward both `apiKey` and `headers`. Use `getApiKeyForProvider(provider)` only when you explicitly want provider-level API key lookup without model headers or `authHeader` handling ([#1835](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1835))
- Removed deprecated direct `minimax` and `minimax-cn` model IDs, keeping only `MiniMax-M2.7` and `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`. Update pinned model IDs to one of those supported direct MiniMax models, or use another provider route that still exposes the older IDs ([#2596](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2596) by [@liyuan97](https://github.com/liyuan97))

#### Migration Notes

Before:

```ts
const apiKey = await ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKey(model);
return streamSimple(model, messages, { apiKey });
```

After:

```ts
const auth = await ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders(model);
if (!auth.ok) throw new Error(auth.error);
return streamSimple(model, messages, {
  apiKey: auth.apiKey,
  headers: auth.headers,
});
```

### Added

- Added `sessionDir` setting support in global and project `settings.json` so session storage can be configured without passing `--session-dir` on every invocation ([#2598](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2598) by [@smcllns](https://github.com/smcllns))
- Added a startup onboarding hint in the interactive header telling users pi can explain its own features and documentation ([#2620](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2620) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Added `edit` tool multi-edit support so one call can update multiple separate, disjoint regions in the same file while matching all replacements against the original file content
- Added support for `PI_TUI_WRITE_LOG` directory paths, creating a unique log file (`tui-<timestamp>-<pid>.log`) per instance for easier debugging of multiple pi sessions ([#2508](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2508) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed file mutation queue ordering so concurrent `edit` and `write` operations targeting the same file stay serialized in request order instead of being reordered during queue-key resolution
- Fixed `models.json` shell-command auth and headers to resolve at request time instead of being cached into long-lived model state. pi now leaves TTL, caching, and recovery policy to user-provided wrapper commands because arbitrary shell commands need provider-specific strategies ([#1835](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1835))
- Fixed Google and Vertex cost calculation to subtract cached prompt tokens from billable input tokens instead of double-counting them when providers report `cachedContentTokenCount` ([#2588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2588) by [@sparkleMing](https://github.com/sparkleMing))
- Added missing `ajv` direct dependency; previously relied on transitive install via `@mariozechner/pi-ai` which broke standalone installs ([#2252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2252))
- Fixed `/export` HTML backgrounds to honor `theme.export.pageBg`, `cardBg`, and `infoBg` instead of always deriving them from `userMessageBg` ([#2565](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2565))
- Fixed interactive bash execution collapsed previews to recompute visual line wrapping at render time, so previews respect the current terminal width after resizes and split-pane width changes ([#2569](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2569))
- Fixed RPC `get_session_stats` to expose `contextUsage`, so headless clients can read actual current context-window usage instead of deriving it from token totals ([#2550](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2550))
- Fixed `pi update` for git packages to fetch only the tracked target branch with `--no-tags`, reducing unrelated branch and tag noise while preserving force-push-safe updates ([#2548](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2548))
- Fixed print and JSON modes to emit `session_shutdown` before exit, so extensions can release long-lived resources and non-interactive runs terminate cleanly ([#2576](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2576))
- Fixed GitHub Copilot OpenAI Responses requests to omit the `reasoning` field entirely when no reasoning effort is requested, avoiding `400` errors from Copilot `gpt-5-mini` rejecting `reasoning: { effort: "none" }` during internal summary calls ([#2567](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2567))
- Fixed blockquote text color breaking after inline links (and other inline elements) due to missing style restoration prefix
- Fixed slash-command Tab completion from immediately chaining into argument autocomplete after completing the command name, restoring flows like `/model` that submit into a selector dialog ([#2577](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2577))
- Fixed stale content and incorrect viewport tracking after TUI content shrinks or transient components inflate the working area ([#2126](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2126) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed `@` autocomplete to debounce editor-triggered searches, cancel in-flight `fd` lookups cleanly, and keep suggestions visible while results refresh ([#1278](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1278))

## [0.62.0] - 2026-03-23

### New Features

- Built-in tools as extensible ToolDefinitions. Extension authors can now override rendering of built-in read/write/edit/bash/grep/find/ls tools with custom `renderCall`/`renderResult` components. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- Unified source provenance via `sourceInfo`. All resources, commands, tools, skills, and prompt templates now carry structured `sourceInfo` with path, scope, and source metadata. Visible in autocomplete, RPC discovery, and SDK introspection. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- AWS Bedrock cost allocation tagging. New `requestMetadata` option on `BedrockOptions` forwards key-value pairs to the Bedrock Converse API for AWS Cost Explorer split cost allocation.

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `ToolDefinition.renderCall` and `renderResult` semantics. Fallback rendering now happens only when a renderer is not defined for that slot. If `renderCall` or `renderResult` is defined, it must return a `Component`.
- Changed slash command provenance to use `sourceInfo` consistently. RPC `get_commands`, `RpcSlashCommand`, and SDK `SlashCommandInfo` no longer expose `location` or `path`. Use `sourceInfo` instead ([#1734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1734))
- Removed legacy `source` fields from `Skill` and `PromptTemplate`. Use `sourceInfo.source` for provenance instead ([#1734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1734))
- Removed `ResourceLoader.getPathMetadata()`. Resource provenance is now attached directly to loaded resources via `sourceInfo` ([#1734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1734))
- Removed `extensionPath` from `RegisteredCommand` and `RegisteredTool`. Use `sourceInfo.path` for provenance instead ([#1734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1734))

#### Migration Notes

Resource, command, and tool provenance now use `sourceInfo` consistently.

Common updates:
- RPC `get_commands`: replace `path` and `location` with `sourceInfo.path`, `sourceInfo.scope`, and `sourceInfo.source`
- `SlashCommandInfo`: replace `command.path` and `command.location` with `command.sourceInfo`
- `Skill` and `PromptTemplate`: replace `.source` with `.sourceInfo.source`
- `RegisteredCommand` and `RegisteredTool`: replace `.extensionPath` with `.sourceInfo.path`
- Custom `ResourceLoader` implementations: remove `getPathMetadata()` and read provenance from loaded resources directly

Examples:
- `command.path` -> `command.sourceInfo.path`
- `command.location === "user"` -> `command.sourceInfo.scope === "user"`
- `skill.source` -> `skill.sourceInfo.source`
- `tool.extensionPath` -> `tool.sourceInfo.path`

### Changed

- Built-in tools now work like custom tools in extensions. To get built-in tool definitions, import `readToolDefinition` / `createReadToolDefinition()` and the equivalent `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` exports from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`.
- Cleaned up `buildSystemPrompt()` so built-in tool snippets and tool-local guidelines come from built-in `ToolDefinition` metadata, while cross-tool and global prompt rules stay in system prompt construction.
- Added structured `sourceInfo` to `pi.getAllTools()` results for built-in, SDK, and extension tools ([#1734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1734))

### Fixed

- Fixed extension command name conflicts so extensions with duplicate command names can load together. Conflicting extension commands now get numeric invocation suffixes in load order, for example `/review:1` and `/review:2` ([#1061](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1061))
- Fixed slash command source attribution for extension commands, prompt templates, and skills in autocomplete and command discovery ([#1734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1734))
- Fixed auto-resized image handling to enforce the inline image size limit on the final base64 payload, return text-only fallbacks when resizing cannot produce a safe image, and avoid falling back to the original image in `read` and `@file` auto-resize paths ([#2055](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2055))
- Fixed `pi update` for git packages to skip destructive reset, clean, and reinstall steps when the fetched target already matches the local checkout ([#2503](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2503))
- Fixed print and JSON mode to take over stdout during non-interactive startup, keeping package-manager and other incidental chatter off protocol/output stdout ([#2482](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2482))
- Fixed cli-highlight auto-detection for languageless code blocks that misidentified prose as programming languages and colored random English words as keywords
- Fixed Anthropic thinking disable handling to send `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` for reasoning-capable models when thinking is explicitly off ([#2022](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2022))
- Fixed explicit thinking disable handling across Google, Google Vertex, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI Responses, and OpenRouter-backed OpenAI-compatible completions ([#2490](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2490))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay for foreign tool-call item IDs by hashing foreign IDs into bounded `fc_<hash>` IDs
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions streams to ignore null chunks instead of crashing ([#2466](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2466) by [@Cheng-Zi-Qing](https://github.com/Cheng-Zi-Qing))
- Fixed `truncateToWidth()` performance for very large strings by streaming truncation ([#2447](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2447))
- Fixed markdown heading styling being lost after inline code spans within headings

## [0.61.1] - 2026-03-20

### New Features

- Typed `tool_call` handler return values via `ToolCallEventResult` exports from the top-level package and core extension entry. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- Updated default models for `zai`, `cerebras`, `minimax`, and `minimax-cn`, and aligned MiniMax catalog coverage and limits with the current provider lineup. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

### Added

- Added `ToolCallEventResult` to the `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` top-level and core extension exports so extension authors can type explicit `tool_call` handler return values ([#2458](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2458))

### Changed

- Changed the default models for `zai`, `cerebras`, `minimax`, and `minimax-cn` to match the current provider lineup, and added missing `MiniMax-M2.1-highspeed` model entries with normalized MiniMax context limits ([#2445](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2445) by [@1500256797](https://github.com/1500256797))

### Fixed

- Fixed `ctrl+z` suspend and `fg` resume reliability by keeping the process alive until the `SIGCONT` handler restores the TUI, avoiding immediate process exit in environments with no other live event-loop handles ([#2454](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2454))
- Fixed `createAgentSession({ agentDir })` to derive the default persisted session path from the provided `agentDir`, keeping session storage aligned with settings, auth, models, and resource loading ([#2457](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2457))
- Fixed shared keybinding resolution to stop user overrides from evicting unrelated default shortcuts such as selector confirm and editor cursor keys ([#2455](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2455))
- Fixed Termux software keyboard height changes from forcing full-screen redraws and replaying TUI history on every toggle ([#2467](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2467))
- Fixed project-local npm package updates to install npm `latest` instead of reusing stale saved dependency ranges, and added `Did you mean ...?` suggestions when `pi update <source>` omits the configured npm or git source prefix ([#2459](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2459))

## [0.61.0] - 2026-03-20

### New Features

- Namespaced keybinding ids and a unified keybinding manager across the app and TUI. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md) and [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- JSONL session export and import via `/export <path.jsonl>` and `/import <path.jsonl>`. See [README.md](README.md) and [docs/session.md](docs/session.md).
- Resizable sidebar in HTML share and export views. See [README.md](README.md).

### Breaking Changes

- Interactive keybinding ids are now namespaced, and `keybindings.json` now uses those same canonical namespaced ids. Older config files are migrated automatically on startup. Custom editors and extension UI components still receive an injected `keybindings: KeybindingsManager`. They do not call `getKeybindings()` or `setKeybindings()` themselves. Declaration merging applies to that injected type ([#2391](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2391))
- Extension author migration: update `keyHint()`, `keyText()`, and injected `keybindings.matches(...)` calls from old built-in names like `"expandTools"`, `"selectConfirm"`, and `"interrupt"` to namespaced ids like `"app.tools.expand"`, `"tui.select.confirm"`, and `"app.interrupt"`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md) for the full list. `pi.registerShortcut("ctrl+shift+p", ...)` is unchanged because extension shortcuts still use raw key combos, not keybinding ids.

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.4-mini` to the `openai-codex` model catalog ([#2334](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2334) by [@justram](https://github.com/justram))
- Added JSONL session export and import via `/export <path.jsonl>` and `/import <path.jsonl>` ([#2356](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2356) by [@hjanuschka](https://github.com/hjanuschka))
- Added a resizable sidebar to HTML share and export views ([#2435](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2435) by [@dmmulroy](https://github.com/dmmulroy))

### Fixed

- Tests for session-selector-rename and tree-selector are now keybinding-agnostic, resetting editor keybindings to defaults before each test so user `keybindings.json` cannot cause failures ([#2360](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2360))
- Fixed custom `keybindings.json` overrides to shadow conflicting default shortcuts globally, so bindings such as `cursorUp: ["up", "ctrl+p"]` no longer leave default actions like model cycling active ([#2391](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2391))
- Fixed concurrent `edit` and `write` mutations targeting the same file to run serially, preventing interleaved file writes from overwriting each other ([#2327](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2327))
- Fixed RPC mode to redirect unexpected stdout writes to stderr so JSONL responses remain parseable ([#2388](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2388))
- Fixed auto-retry with tool-using retry responses so `session.prompt()` waits for the full retry loop, including tool execution, before returning ([#2440](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2440) by [@pasky](https://github.com/pasky))
- Fixed `/model` to refresh scoped model lists after `models.json` changes, avoiding stale selector contents ([#2408](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2408) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed `validateToolArguments()` to fall back gracefully when AJV schema compilation is blocked in restricted runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers, allowing tool execution to proceed without schema validation ([#2395](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2395))
- Fixed CLI startup to suppress process warnings from leaking into terminal, print, and RPC output ([#2404](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2404))
- Fixed bash tool rendering to show elapsed time at the bottom of the tool block ([#2406](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2406))
- Fixed custom theme file watching to reload updated theme contents from disk instead of keeping stale cached theme data ([#2417](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2417), [#2003](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2003))
- Fixed footer Git branch refreshes to run asynchronously so branch watcher updates do not block the UI ([#2418](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2418))
- Fixed invalid extension provider registrations to surface an extension error without preventing other providers from loading ([#2431](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2431))
- Fixed Windows bash execution hanging for commands that spawn detached descendants inheriting stdout/stderr handles, which caused `agent-browser` and similar commands to spin forever ([#2389](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2389) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))
- Fixed `google-vertex` API key resolution to ignore placeholder auth markers like `<authenticated>` and fall back to ADC instead of sending them as literal API keys ([#2335](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2335))
- Fixed desktop clipboard text copy to prefer native OS clipboard integration before shell fallbacks, improving reliability on macOS and Windows ([#2347](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2347))
- Fixed Bun Bedrock provider registration to survive provider resets and session reloads in compiled binaries ([#2350](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2350) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))
- Fixed OpenRouter reasoning requests to use the provider's nested reasoning payload, restoring thinking level support for OpenRouter models and custom compat settings ([#2298](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2298) by [@PriNova](https://github.com/PriNova))
- Fixed Bedrock application inference profiles to support prompt caching when `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1` is set, covering profile ARNs that do not expose the underlying Claude model name ([#2346](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2346) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.60.0] - 2026-03-18

### New Features

- Fork existing sessions directly from the CLI with `--fork <path|id>`, which copies a source session into a new session in the current project. See [README.md](README.md).
- Extensions and SDK callers can reuse pi's built-in local bash backend via `createLocalBashOperations()` for `user_bash` interception and custom bash integrations. See [docs/extensions.md#user_bash](docs/extensions.md#user_bash).
- Startup no longer updates unpinned npm and git packages automatically. Use `pi update` explicitly, while interactive mode checks for updates in the background and notifies you when newer packages are available. See [README.md](README.md).

### Breaking Changes

- Changed package startup behavior so installed unpinned packages are no longer checked or updated during startup. Use `pi update` to apply npm/git package updates, while interactive mode now checks for available package updates in the background and notifies you when updates are available ([#1963](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1963))

### Added

- Added `--fork <path|id>` CLI flag to fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly into a new session ([#2290](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2290))
- Added `createLocalBashOperations()` export so extensions and SDK callers can wrap pi's built-in local bash backend for `user_bash` handling and other custom bash integrations ([#2299](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2299))

### Fixed

- Fixed active model selection to refresh immediately after dynamic provider registrations or updates change the available model set ([#2291](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2291))
- Fixed tmux xterm `modifyOtherKeys` matching for `Backspace`, `Escape`, and `Space`, and resolved raw `\x08` backspace ambiguity by treating Windows Terminal sessions differently from legacy terminals ([#2293](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2293))
- Fixed Gemini 3 and Antigravity image tool results to stay inline as multimodal tool responses instead of being rerouted through separate follow-up messages ([#2052](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2052))
- Fixed bundled Bedrock Claude 4.6 model metadata to use the correct 200K context window instead of 1M ([#2305](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2305))
- Fixed `/reload` to reload keybindings from disk so changes in `keybindings.json` apply immediately ([#2309](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2309))
- Fixed lazy built-in provider registration so compiled Bun binaries can still load providers on first use without eagerly bundling provider SDKs ([#2314](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2314))
- Fixed built-in OAuth login flows to use aligned callback handling across Anthropic, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and OpenAI Codex, and fixed OpenAI Codex login to complete immediately once the browser callback succeeds ([#2316](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2316))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible z.ai `network_error` responses to trigger error handling and retries instead of being treated as successful assistant output ([#2313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2313))
- Fixed print mode to merge piped stdin into the initial prompt when both stdin and an explicit prompt are provided ([#2315](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2315))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay in coding-agent to normalize oversized resumed tool call IDs before sending them back to OpenAI Codex and other Responses-compatible targets ([#2328](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2328))
- Fixed tmux extended-keys warning to stay hidden when the tmux server is unreachable, avoiding false startup warnings in sandboxed environments ([#2311](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2311) by [@kaffarell](https://github.com/kaffarell))

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

### New Features

- Faster startup by lazy-loading `@mariozechner/pi-ai` provider SDKs on first use instead of import time ([#2297](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2297))
- Better provider retry behavior when providers return error messages as responses ([#2264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2264))
- Better terminal integration via OSC 133 command-executed markers ([#2242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2242))
- Better Git footer branch detection for repositories using reftable storage ([#2300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2300))

### Breaking Changes

- Changed custom tool system prompt behavior so extension and SDK tools are included in the default `Available tools` section only when they provide `promptSnippet`. Omitting `promptSnippet` now leaves the tool out of that section instead of falling back to `description` ([#2285](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2285))

### Changed

- Lazy-load built-in `@mariozechner/pi-ai` provider modules and root provider wrappers so coding-agent startup no longer eagerly loads provider SDKs before first use ([#2297](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2297))

### Fixed

- Fixed session title handling in `/tree`, compaction, and branch summarization so empty title clears render correctly and `session_info` entries stay out of summaries ([#2304](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2304) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed footer branch detection for Git repositories using reftable storage so branch names still appear correctly in the footer ([#2300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2300))
- Fixed rendered user messages to emit an OSC 133 command-executed marker after command output, improving terminal prompt integration ([#2242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2242))
- Fixed provider retry handling to treat provider-returned error messages as retryable failures instead of successful responses ([#2264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2264))
- Fixed Claude 4.6 context window overrides in bundled model metadata so coding-agent sees the intended model limits after generated catalogs are rebuilt ([#2286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2286))

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Fixed steering messages to wait until the current assistant message's tool-call batch fully finishes instead of skipping pending tool calls.

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Improved settings, theme, thinking, and show-images selector layouts by using configurable select-list primary column sizing ([#2154](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2154) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

### Fixed

- Fixed fuzzy `edit` matching to normalize Unicode compatibility variants before comparison, reducing false "oldText not found" failures for text such as CJK and full-width characters ([#2044](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2044))
- Fixed `/model <ref>` exact matching and picker search to recognize canonical `provider/model` references when model IDs themselves contain `/`, such as LM Studio models like `unsloth/qwen3.5-35b-a3b` ([#2174](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2174))
- Fixed Anthropic OAuth manual login and token refresh by using the localhost callback URI for pasted redirect/code flows and omitting `scope` from refresh-token requests ([#2169](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2169))
- Fixed stale scrollback remaining after session switches by clearing the screen before wiping scrollback ([#2155](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2155) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed extra blank lines after markdown block elements in rendered output ([#2152](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2152) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `pi uninstall` alias for `pi install --uninstall` convenience

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket protocol to include required headers and properly terminate SSE streams on connection close ([#1961](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1961))
- Fixed WSL clipboard image fallback to properly handle missing clipboard utilities and permission errors ([#1722](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1722))
- Fixed extension `session_start` hook firing before TUI was ready, causing UI operations in `session_start` handlers to fail ([#2035](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2035))
- Fixed Windows shell and path handling for package manager operations and autocomplete to properly handle drive letters and mixed path separators
- Fixed Bedrock prompt caching being enabled for non-Claude models, causing API errors ([#2053](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2053))
- Fixed Qwen models via OpenAI-compatible providers by adding `qwen-chat-template` compat mode that uses Qwen's native chat template format ([#2020](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2020))
- Fixed Bedrock unsigned thinking replay to handle edge cases with empty or malformed thinking blocks ([#2063](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2063))
- Fixed headless clipboard fallback logging spurious errors in non-interactive environments ([#2056](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2056))
- Fixed `models.json` provider compat flags not being honored when loading custom model definitions ([#2062](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2062))
- Fixed xhigh reasoning effort detection for Claude Opus 4.6 to match by model ID instead of requiring explicit capability flag ([#2040](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2040))
- Fixed prompt cwd containing Windows backslashes breaking bash tool execution by normalizing to forward slashes ([#2080](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2080))
- Fixed editor paste to preserve literal content instead of normalizing newlines, preventing content corruption for text with embedded escape sequences ([#2064](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2064))
- Fixed skill discovery recursing past skill root directories when nested SKILL.md files exist ([#2075](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2075))
- Fixed tab completion to preserve `./` prefix when completing relative paths ([#2087](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2087))
- Fixed npm package installs and lookups being tied to the active repository Node version by adding `npmCommand` as an argv-style settings override for package manager operations ([#2072](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2072))
- Fixed `ctx.ui.getEditorText()` in the extension API returning paste markers (e.g., `[paste #1 +24 lines]`) instead of the actual pasted content ([#2084](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2084))
- Fixed startup crash when downloading `fd`/`ripgrep` on first run by using `pipeline()` instead of `finished(readable.pipe(writable))` so stream errors from timeouts are caught properly, and increased the download timeout from 10s to 120s ([#2066](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2066))

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### New Features

- Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, and related Bedrock models now use a 1M token context window (up from 200K) ([#2135](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2135) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).
- Extension tool calls now execute in parallel by default, with sequential `tool_call` preflight preserved for extension interception.
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable support for the `google-vertex` provider as an alternative to Application Default Credentials ([#1976](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1976) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc)).
- Extensions can supply deterministic session IDs via `newSession()` ([#2130](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2130) by [@zhahaoyu](https://github.com/zhahaoyu)).

### Added

- Added `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable support for the `google-vertex` provider as an alternative to Application Default Credentials ([#1976](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1976) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc))
- Added custom session ID support in `newSession()` for extensions that need deterministic session paths ([#2130](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2130) by [@zhahaoyu](https://github.com/zhahaoyu))

### Changed

- Changed extension tool interception to use agent-core `beforeToolCall` and `afterToolCall` hooks instead of wrapper-based interception. Tool calls now execute in parallel by default, extension `tool_call` preflight still runs sequentially, and final tool results are emitted in assistant source order.
- Raised Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, and related Bedrock model context windows from 200K to 1M tokens ([#2135](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2135) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

### Fixed

- Fixed `tool_call` extension handlers observing stale `sessionManager` state during multi-tool turns by draining queued agent events before each `tool_call` preflight. In parallel tool mode this guarantees state through the current assistant tool-calling message, but not sibling tool results from the same assistant message.
- Fixed interactive input fields backed by the TUI `Input` component to scroll by visual column width for wide Unicode text (CJK, fullwidth characters), preventing rendered line overflow and TUI crashes in places like search and filter inputs ([#1982](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1982))
- Fixed `shift+tab` and other modified Tab bindings in tmux when `extended-keys-format` is left at the default `xterm`
- Fixed EXIF orientation not being applied during image convert and resize, causing JPEG and WebP images from phone cameras to display rotated or mirrored ([#2105](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2105) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))
- Fixed the default coding-agent system prompt to include only the current date in ISO format, not the current time, so prompt prefixes stay cacheable across reloads and resumed sessions ([#2131](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2131))
- Fixed retry regex to match `server_error` and `internal_error` error types from providers, improving automatic retry coverage ([#2117](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2117) by [@MadKangYu](https://github.com/MadKangYu))
- Fixed example extensions to support `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` environment variable for custom agent directory paths ([#2009](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2009) by [@smithbm2316](https://github.com/smithbm2316))
- Fixed tool result images not being sent in `function_call_output` items for OpenAI Responses API providers, causing image data to be silently dropped in tool results ([#2104](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2104))
- Fixed assistant content being sent as structured content blocks instead of plain strings in the `openai-completions` provider, causing errors with some OpenAI-compatible backends ([#2008](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2008) by [@geraldoaax](https://github.com/geraldoaax))
- Fixed error details in OpenAI Responses `response.failed` handler to include status code, error code, and message instead of a generic failure ([#1956](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1956) by [@drewburr](https://github.com/drewburr))
- Fixed GitHub Copilot device-code login polling to respect OAuth slow-down intervals, wait before the first token poll, and include a clearer clock-drift hint in WSL/VM environments when repeated slow-downs lead to timeout
- Fixed usage statistics not being captured for OpenAI-compatible providers that return usage in `choice.usage` instead of the standard `chunk.usage` (e.g., Moonshot/Kimi) ([#2017](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2017))
- Fixed editor scroll indicator rendering crash in narrow terminal widths ([#2103](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2103) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Fixed tab characters in editor and input paste not being normalized to spaces ([#2027](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2027), [#1975](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1975) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Fixed `wordWrapLine` overflow when wide characters (CJK, fullwidth) fall exactly at the wrap boundary ([#2082](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2082) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))
- Fixed paste markers not being treated as atomic segments in editor word wrapping and cursor navigation ([#2111](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2111) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.57.1] - 2026-03-07

### New Features
- Tree branch folding and segment-jump navigation in `/tree`, with `Ctrl+←`/`Ctrl+→` and `Alt+←`/`Alt+→` shortcuts while `←`/`→` and `Page Up`/`Page Down` remain available for paging. See [docs/tree.md](docs/tree.md) and [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).
- `session_directory` extension event for customizing session directory paths before session manager creation. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- Digit keybindings (`0-9`) in the TUI keybinding system, including modified combos like `ctrl+1`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Added
- Added `/tree` branch folding and segment-jump navigation with `Ctrl+←`/`Ctrl+→` and `Alt+←`/`Alt+→`, while keeping `←`/`→` and `Page Up`/`Page Down` for paging ([#1724](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1724) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Added `session_directory` extension event that fires before session manager creation, allowing extensions to customize the session directory path based on cwd and other factors. CLI `--session-dir` flag takes precedence over extension-provided paths ([#1730](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1730) by [@hjanuschka](https://github.com/hjanuschka)).
- Added digit keys (`0-9`) to the keybinding system, including Kitty CSI-u and xterm `modifyOtherKeys` support for bindings like `ctrl+1` ([#1905](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1905))

### Fixed
- Fixed custom tool collapsed/expanded rendering in HTML exports. Custom tools that define different collapsed vs expanded displays now render correctly in exported HTML, with expandable sections when both states differ and direct display when only expanded exists ([#1934](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1934) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed tmux startup guidance and keyboard setup warnings for modified key handling, including Ghostty `shift+enter=text:\n` remap guidance and tmux `extended-keys-format` detection ([#1872](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1872))
- Fixed z.ai context overflow recovery so `model_context_window_exceeded` errors trigger auto-compaction instead of surfacing as unhandled stop reason failures ([#1937](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1937))
- Fixed autocomplete selection ignoring typed text: highlight now follows the first prefix match as the user types, and exact matches are always selected on Enter ([#1931](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1931) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed slash-command Tab completion to immediately open argument completions when available ([#1481](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1481) by [@barapa](https://github.com/barapa))
- Fixed explicit `pi -e <path>` extensions losing command and tool conflicts to discovered extensions by giving CLI-loaded extensions higher precedence ([#1896](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1896))
- Fixed Windows external editor launch for `Ctrl+G` and `ctx.ui.editor()` so shell-based commands like `EDITOR="code --wait"` work correctly ([#1925](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1925))

## [0.57.0] - 2026-03-07

### New Features

- Extensions can intercept and modify provider request payloads via `before_provider_request`. See [docs/extensions.md#before_provider_request](docs/extensions.md#before_provider_request).
- Extension UIs can use non-capturing overlays with explicit focus control via `OverlayOptions.nonCapturing` and `OverlayHandle.focus()` / `unfocus()` / `isFocused()`. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [../tui/README.md](../tui/README.md).
- RPC mode now uses strict LF-only JSONL framing for robust payload handling. See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md).

### Breaking Changes

- RPC mode now uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only instead of using generic line readers such as Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads ([#1911](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1911))

### Added

- Added `before_provider_request` extension hook so extensions can inspect or replace provider payloads before requests are sent, with an example in `examples/extensions/provider-payload.ts`
- Added non-capturing overlay focus control for extension UIs via `OverlayOptions.nonCapturing` and `OverlayHandle.focus()` / `unfocus()` / `isFocused()` ([#1916](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1916) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Changed

- Overlay compositing in extension UIs now uses focus order so focused overlays render on top while preserving stack semantics for show/hide behavior ([#1916](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1916) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Fixed

- Fixed RPC mode stdin/stdout framing to use strict LF-delimited JSONL instead of `readline`, so payloads containing `U+2028` or `U+2029` no longer corrupt command or event streams ([#1911](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1911))
- Fixed automatic overlay focus restoration in extension UIs to skip non-capturing overlays, and fixed overlay hide behavior to only reassign focus when the hidden overlay had focus ([#1916](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1916) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Fixed `pi config` misclassifying `~/.agents/skills` as project-scoped in non-git directories under `$HOME`, so toggling those skills no longer writes project overrides to `.pi/settings.json` ([#1915](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1915))

## [0.56.3] - 2026-03-06

### New Features

- `claude-sonnet-4-6` model available via the `google-antigravity` provider ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859))
- Custom editors can now define their own `onEscape`/`onCtrlD` handlers without being overwritten by app defaults, enabling vim-mode extensions ([#1838](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1838))
- Shift+Enter and Ctrl+Enter now work inside tmux via xterm modifyOtherKeys fallback ([docs/tmux.md](docs/tmux.md), [#1872](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1872))
- Auto-compaction is now resilient to persistent API errors (e.g. 529 overloaded) and no longer retriggers spuriously after compaction ([#1834](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1834), [#1860](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1860))

### Added

- Added `claude-sonnet-4-6` model for the `google-antigravity` provider ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).
- Added [tmux setup documentation](docs/tmux.md) for modified enter key support ([#1872](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1872))

### Fixed

- Fixed custom editors having their `onEscape`/`onCtrlD` handlers unconditionally overwritten by app-level defaults, making vim-style escape handling impossible ([#1838](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1838))
- Fixed auto-compaction retriggering on the first prompt after compaction due to stale pre-compaction assistant usage ([#1860](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1860) by [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks))
- Fixed sessions never auto-compacting when hitting persistent API errors (e.g. 529 overloaded) by estimating context size from the last successful response ([#1834](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1834))
- Fixed compaction summarization requests exceeding context limits by truncating tool results to 2k chars ([#1796](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1796))
- Fixed `/new` leaving startup header content, including the changelog, visible after starting a fresh session ([#1880](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1880))
- Fixed misleading docs and example implying that returning `{ isError: true }` from a tool's `execute` function marks the execution as failed; errors must be signaled by throwing ([#1881](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1881))
- Fixed model switches through non-reasoning models to preserve the saved default thinking level instead of persisting a capability-forced `off` clamp ([#1864](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1864))
- Fixed parallel pi processes failing with false "No API key found" errors due to immediate lockfile contention on `auth.json` and `settings.json` ([#1871](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1871))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses reasoning replay regression that broke multi-turn reasoning continuity ([#1878](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1878))

## [0.56.2] - 2026-03-05

### New Features

- GPT-5.4 support across `openai`, `openai-codex`, `azure-openai-responses`, and `opencode`, with `gpt-5.4` now the default for `openai` and `openai-codex` ([README.md](README.md), [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md)).
- `treeFilterMode` setting to choose the default `/tree` filter mode (`default`, `no-tools`, `user-only`, `labeled-only`, `all`) ([docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md), [#1852](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1852) by [@lajarre](https://github.com/lajarre)).
- Mistral native conversations integration with SDK-backed provider behavior, preserving Mistral-specific thinking and replay semantics ([README.md](README.md), [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md), [#1716](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1716)).

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.4` model availability for `openai`, `openai-codex`, `azure-openai-responses`, and `opencode` providers.
- Added `gpt-5.3-codex` fallback model availability for `github-copilot` until upstream model catalogs include it ([#1853](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1853)).
- Added `treeFilterMode` setting to choose the default `/tree` filter mode (`default`, `no-tools`, `user-only`, `labeled-only`, `all`) ([#1852](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1852) by [@lajarre](https://github.com/lajarre)).

### Changed

- Updated the default models for the `openai` and `openai-codex` providers to `gpt-5.4`.

### Fixed

- Fixed GPT-5.3 Codex follow-up turns dropping OpenAI Responses assistant `phase` metadata by preserving replayable signatures in session history and forwarding `phase` back to the Responses API ([#1819](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1819)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay to omit empty thinking blocks, avoiding invalid no-op reasoning items in follow-up turns.
- Updated Mistral integration to use the native SDK-backed provider and conversations API, including coding-agent model/provider wiring and Mistral setup documentation ([#1716](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1716)).
- Fixed Antigravity reliability: endpoint cascade on 403/404, added autopush sandbox fallback, removed extra fingerprint headers ([#1830](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1830)).
- Fixed `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` extension imports in published installs by resolving the subpath directly from built `dist` files instead of package-root wrapper shims ([#1856](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1856)).
- Fixed Gemini 3 multi-turn tool use losing structured context by using `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel for unsigned function calls instead of text fallback ([#1829](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1829)).
- Fixed model selector filter not accepting typed characters in VS Code 1.110+ due to missing Kitty CSI-u printable decoding in the `Input` component ([#1857](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1857))
- Fixed editor/footer visibility drift during terminal resize by forcing full redraws when terminal width or height changes ([#1844](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1844) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr)).
- Fixed footer width truncation for wide Unicode text (session name, model, provider) to prevent TUI crashes from rendered lines exceeding terminal width ([#1833](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1833)).
- Fixed Windows write preview background artifacts by normalizing CRLF content (`\r\n`) to LF for display rendering in tool output previews ([#1854](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1854)).

## [0.56.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Fixed extension alias fallback resolution to use ESM-aware resolution for `jiti` aliases in global installs ([#1821](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1821) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed markdown blockquote rendering to isolate blockquote styling from default text style, preventing style leakage.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-03-04

### New Features

- Added OpenCode Go provider support with `opencode-go` model defaults and `OPENCODE_API_KEY` environment variable support ([docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md), [#1757](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1757)).
- Added `branchSummary.skipPrompt` setting to skip branch summarization prompts during tree navigation ([docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md), [#1792](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1792)).
- Added `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` fallback model availability for Google provider catalogs when upstream model metadata lags ([README.md](README.md), [#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785)).

### Breaking Changes

- Changed scoped model thinking semantics. Scoped entries without an explicit `:<thinking>` suffix now inherit the current session thinking level when selected, instead of applying a startup-captured default.
- Moved Node OAuth runtime exports off the top-level `@mariozechner/pi-ai` entry. OAuth login and refresh must be imported from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).

### Added

- Added `branchSummary.skipPrompt` setting to skip the summary prompt when navigating branches ([#1792](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1792)).
- Added OpenCode Go provider support with `opencode-go` model defaults and `OPENCODE_API_KEY` environment variable support ([#1757](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1757)).
- Added `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` fallback model availability in provider catalogs when upstream catalogs lag ([#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785)).

### Changed

- Updated Antigravity Gemini 3.1 model metadata and request headers to match upstream behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed IME hardware cursor positioning in the custom extension editor (`ctx.ui.editor()` / extension editor dialog) by propagating focus to the internal `Editor`, preventing the terminal cursor from getting stuck at the bottom-right during composition.
- Added OSC 133 semantic zone markers around rendered user messages to support terminal navigation between prompts in iTerm2, WezTerm, Kitty, Ghostty, and other compatible terminals ([#1805](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1805)).
- Fixed markdown blockquotes dropping nested list content in the TUI renderer ([#1787](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1787)).
- Fixed TUI width handling for regional indicator symbols to prevent wrap drift and stale characters during streaming ([#1783](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1783)).
- Fixed Kitty CSI-u handling to ignore unsupported modifiers so modifier-only events do not insert printable characters ([#1807](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1807)).
- Fixed single-line paste handling to insert text atomically and avoid repeated `@` autocomplete scans on large pastes ([#1812](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1812)).
- Fixed extension loading with the new `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` export path by aliasing the oauth subpath in the extension loader and development path mapping ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
- Fixed browser-safe provider loading regressions by preloading the Bedrock provider module in compiled Bun binaries and rebuilding binaries against fresh workspace dependencies ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
- Fixed GNU screen terminal detection by downgrading theme output to 256-color mode for `screen*` TERM values ([#1809](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1809)).
- Fixed branch summarization queue handling so messages typed while summaries are generated are processed correctly ([#1803](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1803)).
- Fixed compaction summary requests to avoid reasoning output for non-reasoning models ([#1793](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1793)).
- Fixed overflow auto-compaction cascades so a single overflow does not trigger repeated compaction loops.
- Fixed `models.json` to allow provider-scoped custom model ids and model-level `baseUrl` overrides ([#1759](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1759), [#1777](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1777)).
- Fixed session selector display sanitization by stripping control characters from session display text ([#1747](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1747)).
- Fixed Groq Qwen3 reasoning effort mapping for OpenAI-compatible models ([#1745](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1745)).
- Fixed Bedrock `AWS_PROFILE` region resolution by honoring profile `region` values ([#1800](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1800)).
- Fixed Gemini 3.1 thinking-level detection for `google` and `google-vertex` providers ([#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785)).
- Fixed browser bundling compatibility for `@mariozechner/pi-ai` by removing Node-only side effects from default browser import paths ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
## [0.55.4] - 2026-03-02

### New Features

- Runtime tool registration now applies immediately in active sessions. Tools registered via `pi.registerTool()` after startup are available to `pi.getAllTools()` and the LLM without `/reload` ([docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md), [examples/extensions/dynamic-tools.ts](examples/extensions/dynamic-tools.ts), [#1720](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1720)).
- Tool definitions can customize the default system prompt with `promptSnippet` (`Available tools`) and `promptGuidelines` (`Guidelines`) while the tool is active ([docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md), [#1720](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1720)).
- Custom tool renderers can suppress transcript output without leaving extra spacing or empty transcript footprint in interactive rendering ([docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md), [#1719](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1719)).

### Added

- Added optional `promptSnippet` to `ToolDefinition` for one-line entries in the default system prompt's `Available tools` section. Active extension tools appear there when registered and active ([#1237](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1237) by [@semtexzv](https://github.com/semtexzv)).
- Added optional `promptGuidelines` to `ToolDefinition` so active tools can append tool-specific bullets to the default system prompt `Guidelines` section ([#1720](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1720)).

### Fixed

- Fixed `pi.registerTool()` dynamic registration after session initialization. Tools registered in `session_start` and later handlers now refresh immediately, become active, and are visible to the LLM without `/reload` ([#1720](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1720))
- Fixed session message persistence ordering by serializing `AgentSession` event processing, preventing `toolResult` entries from being written before their corresponding assistant tool-call messages when extension handlers are asynchronous ([#1717](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1717))
- Fixed spacing artifacts when custom tool renderers intentionally suppress per-call transcript output, including extra blank rows in interactive streaming and non-zero transcript footprint for empty custom renders ([#1719](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1719) by [@alasano](https://github.com/alasano))
- Fixed `session.prompt()` returning before retry completion by creating the retry promise synchronously at `agent_end` dispatch, which closes a race when earlier queued event handlers are async ([#1726](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1726) by [@pasky](https://github.com/pasky))

## [0.55.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Changed the default image paste keybinding on Windows to `alt+v` to avoid `ctrl+v` conflicts with terminal paste behavior ([#1682](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1682) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia)).

## [0.55.2] - 2026-02-27

### New Features

- Extensions can dynamically remove custom providers via `pi.unregisterProvider(name)`, restoring any built-in models that were overridden, without requiring `/reload` ([docs](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/custom-provider.md)).
- `pi.registerProvider()` now takes effect immediately when called outside the initial extension load phase (e.g. from a command handler), removing the need for `/reload` after late registrations.

### Added

- `pi.unregisterProvider(name)` removes a dynamically registered provider and its models from the registry without requiring `/reload`. Built-in models that were overridden by the provider are restored ([#1669](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1669) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).

### Fixed

- `pi.registerProvider()` now takes effect immediately when called after the initial extension load phase (e.g. from a command handler). Previously the registration sat in a pending queue that was never flushed until the next `/reload` ([#1669](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1669) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).
- Fixed duplicate session headers when forking from a point before any assistant message. `createBranchedSession` now defers file creation to `_persist()` when the branched path has no assistant message, matching the `newSession()` contract ([#1672](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1672) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter)).
- Fixed SIGINT being delivered to pi while the process is suspended (e.g. via `ctrl+z`), which could corrupt terminal state on resume ([#1668](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1668) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou)).
- Fixed Z.ai thinking control using wrong parameter name, causing thinking to always be enabled and wasting tokens/latency ([#1674](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1674) by [@okuyam2y](https://github.com/okuyam2y))
- Fixed `redacted_thinking` blocks being silently dropped during Anthropic streaming, and related issues with interleaved-thinking beta headers and temperature being sent alongside extended thinking ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed `(external, cli)` user-agent flag causing 401 errors on Anthropic setup-token endpoint ([#1677](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1677) by [@LazerLance777](https://github.com/LazerLance777))
- Fixed crash when OpenAI-compatible provider returns a chunk with no `choices` array ([#1671](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1671))

## [0.55.1] - 2026-02-26

### New Features

- Added offline startup mode via `--offline` (or `PI_OFFLINE`) to disable startup network operations, with startup network timeouts to avoid hangs in restricted or offline environments.
- Added `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` model support to the `google-gemini-cli` provider ([#1599](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1599) by [@audichuang](https://github.com/audichuang)).

### Fixed

- Fixed offline startup hangs by adding offline startup behavior and network timeouts during managed tool setup ([#1631](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1631) by [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina))
- Fixed Windows VT input initialization in ESM by loading koffi via createRequire, avoiding runtime and bundling issues in end-user environments ([#1627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1627) by [@kaste](https://github.com/kaste))
- Fixed managed `fd`/`rg` bootstrap on Windows in Git Bash by using `extract-zip` for `.zip` archives, searching extracted layouts more robustly, and isolating extraction temp directories to avoid concurrent download races ([#1348](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1348))
- Fixed extension loading on Windows when resolving `@sinclair/typebox` aliases so subpath imports like `@sinclair/typebox/compiler` resolve correctly.
- Fixed adaptive thinking for Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Anthropic and Bedrock providers, and clamped unsupported `xhigh` effort values to supported levels ([#1548](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1548) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed Vertex ADC credential detection race by avoiding caching a false negative during async import initialization ([#1550](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1550) by [@jeremiahgaylord-web](https://github.com/jeremiahgaylord-web))
- Fixed subagent extension example to resolve user agents from the configured agent directory instead of hardcoded paths ([#1559](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1559) by [@tianshuwang](https://github.com/tianshuwang))

## [0.55.0] - 2026-02-24

### Breaking Changes

- Resource precedence for extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and slash-command name collisions is now project-first (`cwd/.pi`) before user-global (`~/.pi/agent`). If you relied on global resources overriding project resources with the same names, rename or reorder your resources.
- Extension registration conflicts no longer unload the entire later extension. All extensions stay loaded, and conflicting command/tool/flag names are resolved by first registration in load order.

## [0.54.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Fixed `.pi` folder being created unnecessarily when only reading settings. The folder is now only created when writing project-specific settings.
- Fixed extension-driven runtime theme changes to persist in settings so `/settings` reflects the active `currentTheme` after `ctx.ui.setTheme(...)` ([#1483](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1483) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Fixed interactive mode freezes during large streaming `write` tool calls by using incremental syntax highlighting while partial arguments stream, with a final full re-highlight after tool-call arguments complete.

## [0.54.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Externalized koffi from bun binary builds, reducing archive sizes by ~15MB per platform (e.g. darwin-arm64: 43MB -> 28MB). Koffi's Windows-only `.node` file is now shipped alongside the Windows binary only.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added default skill auto-discovery for `.agents/skills` locations. Pi now discovers project skills from `.agents/skills` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo), and global skills from `~/.agents/skills`, in addition to existing `.pi` skill paths.

## [0.53.1] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- Added Gemini 3.1 model catalog entries for all built-in providers that currently expose it: `google`, `google-vertex`, `opencode`, `openrouter`, and `vercel-ai-gateway`.
- Added Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking to the `google-antigravity` model catalog.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-02-17

### Breaking Changes

- `SettingsManager` persistence semantics changed for SDK consumers. Setters now update in-memory state immediately and queue disk writes. Code that requires durable on-disk settings must call `await settingsManager.flush()`.
- `AuthStorage` constructor is no longer public. Use static factories (`AuthStorage.create(...)`, `AuthStorage.fromStorage(...)`, `AuthStorage.inMemory(...)`). This breaks code that used `new AuthStorage(...)` directly.

### Added

- Added `SettingsManager.drainErrors()` for caller-controlled settings I/O error handling without manager-side console output.
- Added auth storage backends (`FileAuthStorageBackend`, `InMemoryAuthStorageBackend`) and `AuthStorage.fromStorage(...)` for storage-first auth persistence wiring.
- Added Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-6` model fallback entry to generated model definitions.

### Changed

- `SettingsManager` now uses scoped storage abstraction with per-scope locked read/merge/write persistence for global and project settings.

### Fixed

- Fixed project settings persistence to preserve unrelated external edits via merge-on-write, while still applying in-memory changes for modified keys.
- Fixed auth credential persistence to preserve unrelated external edits to `auth.json` via locked read/merge/write updates.
- Fixed auth load/persist error surfacing by buffering errors and exposing them via `AuthStorage.drainErrors()`.

## [0.52.12] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Added `transport` setting (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, `"auto"`) to `/settings` and `settings.json` for providers that support multiple transports (currently `openai-codex` via OpenAI Codex Responses).

### Changed

- Interactive mode now applies transport changes immediately to the active agent session.
- Settings migration now maps legacy `websockets: boolean` to the new `transport` setting.

## [0.52.11] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Added MiniMax M2.5 model entries for `minimax`, `minimax-cn`, `openrouter`, and `vercel-ai-gateway` providers, plus `minimax-m2.5-free` for `opencode`.

## [0.52.10] - 2026-02-12

### New Features

- Extension terminal input interception via `terminal_input`, allowing extensions to consume or transform raw input before normal TUI handling. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
- Expanded CLI model selection: `--model` now supports `provider/id`, fuzzy matching, and `:<thinking>` suffixes. See [README.md](README.md) and [docs/models.md](docs/models.md).
- Safer package source handling with stricter git source parsing and improved local path normalization. See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).
- New built-in model definition `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` for OpenAI and OpenAI Codex providers.
- Improved OpenAI stream robustness for malformed trailing tool-call JSON in partial chunks.
- Added built-in GLM-5 model support via z.ai and OpenRouter provider catalogs.

### Breaking Changes

- `ContextUsage.tokens` and `ContextUsage.percent` are now `number | null`. After compaction, context token count is unknown until the next LLM response, so these fields return `null`. Extensions that read `ContextUsage` must handle the `null` case. Removed `usageTokens`, `trailingTokens`, and `lastUsageIndex` fields from `ContextUsage` (implementation details that should not have been public) ([#1382](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1382) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Git source parsing is now strict without `git:` prefix: only protocol URLs are treated as git (`https://`, `http://`, `ssh://`, `git://`). Shorthand sources like `github.com/org/repo` and `git@github.com:org/repo` now require the `git:` prefix. ([#1426](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1426))

### Added

- Added extension event forwarding for message and tool execution lifecycles (`message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`, `tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_update`, `tool_execution_end`) ([#1375](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1375) by [@sumeet](https://github.com/sumeet))
- Added `terminal_input` extension event to intercept, consume, or transform raw terminal input before normal TUI handling.
- Added `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` model definition for OpenAI and OpenAI Codex providers (research preview).

### Changed

- Routed GitHub Copilot Claude 4.x models through Anthropic Messages API, with updated Copilot header handling for Claude model requests.

### Fixed

- Fixed context usage percentage in footer showing stale pre-compaction values. After compaction the footer now shows `?/200k` until the next LLM response provides accurate usage ([#1382](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1382) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Fixed `_checkCompaction()` using the first compaction entry instead of the latest, which could cause incorrect overflow detection with multiple compactions ([#1382](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1382) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- `--model` now works without `--provider`, supports `provider/id` syntax, fuzzy matching, and `:<thinking>` suffix (e.g., `--model sonnet:high`, `--model openai/gpt-4o`) ([#1350](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1350) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Fixed local package path normalization for extension sources while tightening git source parsing rules ([#1426](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1426))
- Fixed extension terminal input listeners not being cleared during session resets, which could leave stale handlers active.
- Fixed Termux bootstrap package name for `fd` installation ([#1433](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1433))
- Fixed `@` file autocomplete fuzzy matching to prioritize path-prefix and segment matches for nested paths ([#1423](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1423))
- Fixed OpenAI streaming tool-call parsing to tolerate malformed trailing JSON in partial chunks ([#1424](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1424))

## [0.52.9] - 2026-02-08

### New Features

- Extensions can trigger a full runtime reload via `ctx.reload()`, useful for hot-reloading configuration or restarting the agent. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and the [`reload-runtime` example](examples/extensions/reload-runtime.ts) ([#1371](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1371))
- Short CLI disable aliases: `-ne` (`--no-extensions`), `-ns` (`--no-skills`), and `-np` (`--no-prompt-templates`) for faster interactive usage and scripting.
- `/export` HTML now includes collapsible tool input schemas (parameter names, types, and descriptions), improving session review and sharing workflows ([#1416](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1416) by [@marchellodev](https://github.com/marchellodev)).
- `pi.getAllTools()` now exposes tool parameters in addition to name and description, enabling richer extension integrations ([#1416](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1416) by [@marchellodev](https://github.com/marchellodev)).

### Added

- Added `ctx.reload()` to the extension API for programmatic runtime reload ([#1371](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1371))
- Added short aliases for disable flags: `-ne` for `--no-extensions`, `-ns` for `--no-skills`, `-np` for `--no-prompt-templates`
- `/export` HTML now includes tool input schema (parameter names, types, descriptions) in a collapsible section under each tool ([#1416](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1416) by [@marchellodev](https://github.com/marchellodev))
- `pi.getAllTools()` now returns tool parameters in addition to name and description ([#1416](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1416) by [@marchellodev](https://github.com/marchellodev))

### Fixed

- Fixed extension source parsing so dot-prefixed local paths (for example `.pi/extensions/foo.ts`) are treated as local paths instead of git URLs
- Fixed fd/rg download failing on Windows due to `unzip` not being available; now uses `tar` for both `.tar.gz` and `.zip` extraction, with proper error reporting ([#1348](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1348))
- Fixed RPC mode documentation incorrectly stating `ctx.hasUI` is `false`; it is `true` because dialog and fire-and-forget UI methods work via the RPC sub-protocol. Also documented missing unsupported/degraded methods (`pasteToEditor`, `getAllThemes`, `getTheme`, `setTheme`) ([#1411](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1411) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed `rg` not available in bash tool by downloading it at startup alongside `fd` ([#1348](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1348))
- Fixed `custom-compaction` example to use `ModelRegistry` ([#1387](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1387))
- Google providers now support full JSON Schema in tool declarations (anyOf, oneOf, const, etc.) ([#1398](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1398) by [@jarib](https://github.com/jarib))
- Reverted incorrect Antigravity model change: `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` back to `claude-opus-4-5-thinking` (model does not exist on Antigravity endpoint)
- Updated the Antigravity system instruction to a more compact version for Google Gemini CLI compatibility
- Corrected opencode context windows for Claude Sonnet 4 and 4.5 ([#1383](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1383))
- Fixed subagent example unknown-agent errors to include available agent names ([#1414](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1414) by [@dnouri](https://github.com/dnouri))

## [0.52.8] - 2026-02-07

### New Features

- Emacs-style kill ring (`ctrl+k`/`ctrl+y`/`alt+y`) and undo (`ctrl+z`) in the editor input ([#1373](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1373) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- OpenRouter `auto` model alias (`openrouter:auto`) for automatic model routing ([#1361](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1361) by [@yogasanas](https://github.com/yogasanas))
- Extensions can programmatically paste content into the editor via `pasteToEditor` in the extension UI context. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) ([#1351](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1351) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))
- `pi <package> --help` and invalid subcommands now show helpful output instead of failing silently ([#1347](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1347) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))

### Added

- Added `pasteToEditor` to extension UI context for programmatic editor paste ([#1351](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1351) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))
- Added package subcommand help and friendly error messages for invalid commands ([#1347](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1347) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Added OpenRouter `auto` model alias for automatic model routing ([#1361](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1361) by [@yogasanas](https://github.com/yogasanas))
- Added kill ring (ctrl+k/ctrl+y/alt+y) and undo (ctrl+z) support to the editor input ([#1373](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1373) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))

### Changed

- Replaced Claude Opus 4.5 with Opus 4.6 as default model ([#1345](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1345) by [@calvin-hpnet](https://github.com/calvin-hpnet))

### Fixed

- Fixed temporary git package caches (`-e <git-url>`) to refresh on cache hits for unpinned sources, including detached/no-upstream checkouts
- Fixed aborting retries when an extension customizes the editor ([#1364](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1364) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed autocomplete not propagating to custom editors created by extensions ([#1372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1372) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed extension shutdown to use clean TUI shutdown path, preventing orphaned processes

## [0.52.7] - 2026-02-06

### New Features

- Per-model overrides in `models.json` via `modelOverrides`, allowing customization of built-in provider models without replacing provider model lists. See [docs/models.md#per-model-overrides](docs/models.md#per-model-overrides).
- `models.json` provider `models` now merge with built-in models by `id`, so custom models can be added or replace matching built-ins without full provider replacement. See [docs/models.md#overriding-built-in-providers](docs/models.md#overriding-built-in-providers).
- Bedrock proxy support for unauthenticated endpoints via `AWS_BEDROCK_SKIP_AUTH` and `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_HTTP1`. See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `models.json` provider `models` behavior from full replacement to merge-by-id with built-in models. Built-in models are now kept by default, and custom models upsert by `id`.

### Added

- Added `modelOverrides` in `models.json` to customize individual built-in models per provider without full provider replacement ([#1332](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1332) by [@charles-cooper](https://github.com/charles-cooper))
- Added `AWS_BEDROCK_SKIP_AUTH` and `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_HTTP1` environment variables for connecting to unauthenticated Bedrock proxies ([#1320](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1320) by [@virtuald](https://github.com/virtuald))

### Fixed

- Fixed extra spacing between thinking-only assistant content and subsequent tool execution blocks when assistant messages contain no text
- Fixed queued steering/follow-up/custom messages remaining stuck after threshold auto-compaction by resuming the agent loop when Agent-level queues still contain pending messages ([#1312](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1312) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Fixed `tool_result` extension handlers to chain result patches across handlers instead of last-handler-wins behavior ([#1280](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1280))
- Fixed compromised auth lock files being handled gracefully instead of crashing auth storage initialization ([#1322](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1322))
- Fixed Bedrock adaptive thinking handling for Claude Opus 4.6 with interleaved thinking beta responses ([#1323](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1323) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses API requests to use `store: false` by default to avoid server-side history logging ([#1308](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1308))
- Fixed interactive mode startup by initializing autocomplete after resources are loaded ([#1328](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1328))
- Fixed `modelOverrides` merge behavior for nested objects and documented usage details ([#1062](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1062))

## [0.52.6] - 2026-02-05

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `/exit` command handling. Use `/quit` to exit ([#1303](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1303))

### Fixed

- Fixed `/quit` being shadowed by fuzzy slash command autocomplete matches from skills by adding `/quit` to built-in command autocomplete ([#1303](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1303))
- Fixed local package source parsing and settings normalization regression that misclassified relative paths as git URLs and prevented globally installed local packages from loading after restart ([#1304](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1304))

## [0.52.5] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed thinking level capability detection so Anthropic Opus 4.6 models expose `xhigh` in selectors and cycling

## [0.52.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed extensions setting not respecting `package.json` `pi.extensions` manifest when directory is specified directly ([#1302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1302) by [@hjanuschka](https://github.com/hjanuschka))

## [0.52.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed git package parsing fallback for unknown hosts so enterprise git sources like `git:github.tools.sap/org/repo` are treated as git packages instead of local paths
- Fixed git package `@ref` parsing for shorthand, HTTPS, and SSH source formats, including branch refs with slashes
- Fixed Bedrock default model ID from `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1:0` to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`
- Fixed Bedrock Opus 4.6 model metadata (IDs, cache pricing) and added missing EU profile
- Fixed Claude Opus 4.6 context window metadata to 200000 for Anthropic and OpenCode providers

## [0.52.2] - 2026-02-05

### Changed

- Updated default model for `anthropic` provider to `claude-opus-4-6`
- Updated default model for `openai-codex` provider to `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Updated default model for `amazon-bedrock` provider to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1:0`
- Updated default model for `vercel-ai-gateway` provider to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`
- Updated default model for `opencode` provider to `claude-opus-4-6`

## [0.52.1] - 2026-02-05

## [0.52.0] - 2026-02-05

- Claude Opus 4.6 model support.
- GPT-5.3 Codex model support (OpenAI Codex provider only).
- SSH URL support for git packages. See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).
- `auth.json` API keys now support shell command resolution (`!command`) and environment variable lookup. See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

### Added

- API keys in `auth.json` now support shell command resolution (`!command`) and environment variable lookup, matching the behavior in `models.json`
- Added `minimal-mode.ts` example extension demonstrating how to override built-in tool rendering for a minimal display mode
- Added Claude Opus 4.6 model to the model catalog
- Added GPT-5.3 Codex model to the model catalog (OpenAI Codex provider only)
- Added SSH URL support for git packages ([#1287](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1287) by [@markusn](https://github.com/markusn))
- Model selectors now display the selected model name ([#1275](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1275) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

### Fixed

- Fixed HTML export losing indentation in ANSI-rendered tool output (e.g. JSON code blocks in custom tool results) ([#1269](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1269) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed images being silently dropped when `prompt()` is called with both `images` and `streamingBehavior` during streaming. `steer()`, `followUp()`, and the corresponding RPC commands now accept optional images. ([#1271](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1271) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- CLI `--help`, `--version`, `--list-models`, and `--export` now exit even if extensions keep the event loop alive ([#1285](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1285) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))

- Fixed custom message expand state not being respected ([#1258](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1258) by [@Gurpartap](https://github.com/Gurpartap))
- Fixed skill loader to respect .gitignore, .ignore, and .fdignore when scanning directories

## [0.51.6] - 2026-02-04

### New Features

- Configurable resume keybinding action for opening the session resume selector. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md). ([#1249](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1249) by [@juanibiapina](https://github.com/juanibiapina))

### Added

- Added `resume` as a configurable keybinding action, allowing users to bind a key to open the session resume selector (like `newSession`, `tree`, and `fork`) ([#1249](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1249) by [@juanibiapina](https://github.com/juanibiapina))

### Changed

- Local path support for `pi install` and `pi remove`, with relative path resolution against the settings file. See [docs/packages.md#local-paths](docs/packages.md#local-paths).

### Breaking Changes

- RPC `get_commands` response and `SlashCommandSource` type: renamed `"template"` to `"prompt"` for consistency with the rest of the codebase

### Added

- Added `ExtensionAPI.getCommands()` to let extensions list available slash commands (extensions, prompt templates, skills) for invocation via `prompt` ([#1210](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1210) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))
- Added `commands.ts` example extension and exported `SlashCommandInfo` types for command discovery integrations ([#1210](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1210) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))
- Added local path support for `pi install` and `pi remove` with relative paths stored against the target settings file ([#1216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1216))

- Fixed xhigh thinking level support check to accept gpt-5.2 model IDs ([#1209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1209))

## [0.51.2] - 2026-02-03

### New Features

- Extension tool output expansion controls via ExtensionUIContext getToolsExpanded and setToolsExpanded. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md).

### Added

- Added ExtensionUIContext getToolsExpanded and setToolsExpanded for controlling tool output expansion ([#1199](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1199) by [@academo](https://github.com/academo))
- Added install method detection to show package manager specific update instructions ([#1203](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1203) by [@Itsnotaka](https://github.com/Itsnotaka))

- Fixed @-prefixed tool paths failing to resolve by stripping the prefix ([#1206](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1206))
- Fixed install method detection to avoid stale cached results

## [0.51.1] - 2026-02-02

### New Features

- **Extension API switchSession**: Extensions can now programmatically switch sessions via `ctx.switchSession(sessionPath)`. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md). ([#1187](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1187))
- **Clear on shrink setting**: New `terminal.clearOnShrink` setting keeps the editor and footer pinned to the bottom of the terminal when content shrinks. May cause some flicker due to redraws. Disabled by default. Enable via `/settings` or `PI_CLEAR_ON_SHRINK=1` env var.

### Fixed

- Fixed scoped models not finding valid credentials after logout ([#1194](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1194) by [@terrorobe](https://github.com/terrorobe))
- Fixed Ctrl+D exit closing the parent SSH session due to stdin buffer race condition ([#1185](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1185))
- Fixed emoji cursor positioning in editor input ([#1183](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1183) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.51.0] - 2026-02-01

### Breaking Changes

- **Extension tool signature change**: `ToolDefinition.execute` now uses `(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx)` parameter order to match `AgentTool.execute`. Previously it was `(toolCallId, params, onUpdate, ctx, signal)`. This makes wrapping built-in tools trivial since the first four parameters now align. Update your extensions by swapping the `signal` and `onUpdate` parameters:
  ```ts
  // Before
  async execute(toolCallId, params, onUpdate, ctx, signal) { ... }

  // After
  async execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx) { ... }
  ```

### New Features

- **Android/Termux support**: Pi now runs on Android via Termux. Install with:
  ```bash
  pkg install nodejs termux-api git
  npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
  mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent
  echo "You are running on Android in Termux." > ~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md
  ```
  Clipboard operations fall back gracefully when `termux-api` is unavailable. ([#1164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1164))
- **Bash spawn hook**: Extensions can now intercept and modify bash commands before execution via `pi.setBashSpawnHook()`. Adjust the command string, working directory, or environment variables. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md). ([#1160](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1160) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Linux ARM64 musl support**: Pi now runs on Alpine Linux ARM64 (linux-arm64-musl) via updated clipboard dependency.
- **Nix/Guix support**: `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` environment variable overrides the package path for content-addressed package managers where store paths tokenize poorly. See [README.md#environment-variables](README.md#environment-variables). ([#1153](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1153) by [@odysseus0](https://github.com/odysseus0))
- **Named session filter**: `/resume` picker now supports filtering to show only named sessions via Ctrl+N. Configurable via `toggleSessionNamedFilter` keybinding. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md). ([#1128](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1128) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))
- **Typed tool call events**: Extension developers can narrow `ToolCallEvent` types using `isToolCallEventType()` for better TypeScript support. See [docs/extensions.md#tool-call-events](docs/extensions.md#tool-call-events). ([#1147](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1147) by [@giuseppeg](https://github.com/giuseppeg))
- **Extension UI Protocol**: Full RPC documentation and examples for extension dialogs and notifications, enabling headless clients to support interactive extensions. See [docs/rpc.md#extension-ui-protocol](docs/rpc.md#extension-ui-protocol). ([#1144](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1144) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

### Added

- Added typed `ToolCallEvent.input` per tool with `isToolCallEventType()` type guard for narrowing built-in tool events ([#1147](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1147) by [@giuseppeg](https://github.com/giuseppeg))
- Exported `discoverAndLoadExtensions` from package to enable extension testing without a local repo clone ([#1148](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1148))
- Added Extension UI Protocol documentation to RPC docs covering all request/response types for extension dialogs and notifications ([#1144](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1144) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Added `rpc-demo.ts` example extension exercising all RPC-supported extension UI methods ([#1144](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1144) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Added `rpc-extension-ui.ts` TUI example client demonstrating the extension UI protocol with interactive dialogs ([#1144](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1144) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Added `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` environment variable to override package path for content-addressed package managers (Nix, Guix) where store paths tokenize poorly ([#1153](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1153) by [@odysseus0](https://github.com/odysseus0))
- `/resume` session picker now supports named-only filter toggle (default Ctrl+N, configurable via `toggleSessionNamedFilter`) to show only named sessions ([#1128](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1128) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))

### Fixed

- Fixed `pi update` not updating npm/git packages when called without arguments ([#1151](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1151))
- Fixed `models.json` validation requiring fields documented as optional. Model definitions now only require `id`; all other fields (`name`, `reasoning`, `input`, `cost`, `contextWindow`, `maxTokens`) have sensible defaults. ([#1146](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1146))
- Fixed models resolving relative paths in skill files from cwd instead of skill directory by adding explicit guidance to skills preamble ([#1136](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1136))
- Fixed tree selector losing focus state when navigating entries ([#1142](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1142) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Fixed `cacheRetention` option not being passed through in `buildBaseOptions` ([#1154](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1154))

- Fixed `pi update <source>` installing packages locally when the source is only registered globally ([#1163](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1163) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Fixed tree navigation with summarization overwriting editor content typed during the summarization wait ([#1169](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1169) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.50.9] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added `PI_AI_ANTIGRAVITY_VERSION` environment variable documentation to help text ([#1129](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1129))
- Added `cacheRetention` stream option with provider-specific mappings for prompt cache controls, defaulting to short retention ([#1134](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1134))

## [0.50.8] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added `newSession`, `tree`, and `fork` keybinding actions for `/new`, `/tree`, and `/fork` commands. All unbound by default. ([#1114](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1114) by [@juanibiapina](https://github.com/juanibiapina))
- Added `retry.maxDelayMs` setting to cap maximum server-requested retry delay. When a provider requests a longer delay (e.g., Google's "quota will reset after 5h"), the request fails immediately with an informative error instead of waiting silently. Default: 60000ms (60 seconds). ([#1123](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1123))
- `/resume` session picker: new "Threaded" sort mode (now default) displays sessions in a tree structure based on fork relationships. Compact one-line format with message count and age on the right. ([#1124](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1124) by [@pasky](https://github.com/pasky))

- Added OAuth `modifyModels` hook support for extension-registered providers at registration time. ([#940](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/940) by [@4h9fbZ](https://github.com/4h9fbZ))
- Added Qwen thinking format support for OpenAI-compatible completions via `enable_thinking`. ([#940](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/940) by [@4h9fbZ](https://github.com/4h9fbZ))
- Added sticky column tracking for vertical cursor navigation so the editor restores the preferred column when moving across short lines. ([#1120](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1120) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Added `resources_discover` extension hook to supply additional skills, prompts, and themes on startup and reload.

### Fixed

- Fixed `switchSession()` appending spurious `thinking_level_change` entry to session log on resume. `setThinkingLevel()` is now idempotent. ([#1118](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1118))
- Fixed clipboard image paste on WSL2/WSLg writing invalid PNG files when clipboard provides `image/bmp` format. BMP images are now converted to PNG before saving. ([#1112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1112) by [@lightningRalf](https://github.com/lightningRalf))
- Fixed Kitty keyboard protocol base layout fallback so non-QWERTY layouts do not trigger wrong shortcuts ([#1096](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1096) by [@rytswd](https://github.com/rytswd))

## [0.50.7] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- Multi-file extensions in packages now work correctly. Package resolution now uses the same discovery logic as local extensions: only `index.ts` (or manifest-declared entries) are loaded from subdirectories, not helper modules. ([#1102](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1102))

## [0.50.6] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Added `ctx.getSystemPrompt()` to extension context for accessing the current effective system prompt ([#1098](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1098) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

### Fixed

- Fixed empty rows appearing below footer when content shrinks (e.g., closing `/tree`, clearing multi-line editor) ([#1095](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1095) by [@marckrenn](https://github.com/marckrenn))
- Fixed terminal cursor remaining hidden after exiting TUI via `stop()` when a render was pending ([#1099](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1099) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

- **Character jump navigation** - Bash/Readline-style character search: Ctrl+] jumps forward to the next occurrence of a character, Ctrl+Alt+] jumps backward. ([#1074](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1074) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- **Emacs-style Ctrl+B/Ctrl+F navigation** - Alternative keybindings for word navigation (cursor word left/right) in the editor. ([#1053](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1053) by [@ninlds](https://github.com/ninlds))
- **Line boundary navigation** - Editor jumps to line start when pressing Up at first visual line, and line end when pressing Down at last visual line. ([#1050](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1050) by [@4h9fbZ](https://github.com/4h9fbZ))
- **Performance improvements** - Optimized image line detection and box rendering cache in the TUI for better rendering performance. ([#1084](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1084) by [@can1357](https://github.com/can1357))
- **`set_session_name` RPC command** - Headless clients can now set the session display name programmatically. ([#1075](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1075) by [@dnouri](https://github.com/dnouri))
- **Disable double-escape behavior** - New `"none"` option for `doubleEscapeAction` setting completely disables the double-escape shortcut. ([#973](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/973) by [@juanibiapina](https://github.com/juanibiapina))

### Added

- Added character jump navigation: Ctrl+] jumps forward to next character, Ctrl+Alt+] jumps backward ([#1074](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1074) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Editor now jumps to line start when pressing Up at first visual line, and line end when pressing Down at last visual line ([#1050](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1050) by [@4h9fbZ](https://github.com/4h9fbZ))
- Optimized image line detection and box rendering cache for better TUI performance ([#1084](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1084) by [@can1357](https://github.com/can1357))
- Added `set_session_name` RPC command for headless clients to set session display name ([#1075](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1075) by [@dnouri](https://github.com/dnouri))

### Fixed

- Read tool now handles macOS filenames with curly quotes (U+2019) and NFD Unicode normalization ([#1078](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1078))
- Respect .gitignore, .ignore, and .fdignore files when scanning package resources for skills, prompts, themes, and extensions ([#1072](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1072))

### Added

- Added Kimi For Coding provider support (Moonshot AI's Anthropic-compatible coding API). Set `KIMI_API_KEY` environment variable. See [README.md#kimi-for-coding](README.md#kimi-for-coding).

### Fixed

- Resources now appear before messages when resuming a session, preventing loaded context from appearing at the bottom of the chat.

## [0.50.2] - 2026-01-29

### New Features

- **Hugging Face provider**: Access Hugging Face models via OpenAI-compatible Inference Router. Set `HF_TOKEN` environment variable. See [README.md#hugging-face](README.md#hugging-face).
- **Extended prompt caching**: `PI_CACHE_RETENTION=long` enables 1-hour caching for Anthropic (vs 5min default) and 24-hour for OpenAI (vs in-memory default). Only applies to direct API calls. See [README.md#prompt-caching](README.md#prompt-caching).
- **Configurable autocomplete height**: `autocompleteMaxVisible` setting (3-20 items, default 5) controls dropdown size. Adjust via `/settings` or `settings.json`.
- **Shell-style keybindings**: `alt+b`/`alt+f` for word navigation, `ctrl+d` for delete character forward. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Added

- Added Hugging Face provider support via OpenAI-compatible Inference Router ([#994](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/994))
- Added `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` environment variable to control cache TTL for Anthropic (5m vs 1h) and OpenAI (in-memory vs 24h). Set to `long` for extended retention. ([#967](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/967))
- Added `autocompleteMaxVisible` setting for configurable autocomplete dropdown height (3-20 items, default 5) ([#972](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/972) by [@masonc15](https://github.com/masonc15))

- Autocomplete improvements: better handling of partial matches and edge cases ([#1024](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1024) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))

### Fixed

- External edits to `settings.json` are now preserved when pi reloads or saves unrelated settings. Previously, editing settings.json directly (e.g., removing a package from `packages` array) would be silently reverted on next pi startup when automatic setters like `setLastChangelogVersion()` triggered a save.
- Fixed custom header not displaying correctly with `quietStartup` enabled ([#1039](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1039) by [@tudoroancea](https://github.com/tudoroancea))
- Empty array in package filter now disables all resources instead of falling back to manifest defaults ([#1044](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1044))
- Auto-retry counter now resets after each successful LLM response instead of accumulating across tool-use turns ([#1019](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1019))
- Fixed incorrect `.md` file names in warning messages ([#1041](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1041) by [@llimllib](https://github.com/llimllib))
- Fixed provider name hidden in footer when terminal is narrow ([#981](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/981) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))

### SDK Migration Guide

There are multiple SDK breaking changes since v0.49.3. For the quickest migration, point your agent at `packages/coding-agent/docs/sdk.md`, the SDK examples in `packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk`, and the SDK source in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` and related modules.

### Breaking Changes

- Header values in `models.json` now resolve environment variables (if a header value matches an env var name, the env var value is used). This may change behavior if a literal header value accidentally matches an env var name. ([#909](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/909))
- External packages (npm/git) are now configured via `packages` array in settings.json instead of `extensions`. Existing npm:/git: entries in `extensions` are auto-migrated. ([#645](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/645))
- Resource loading now uses `ResourceLoader` only and settings.json uses arrays for extensions, skills, prompts, and themes ([#645](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/645))
- Removed `discoverAuthStorage` and `discoverModels` from the SDK. `AuthStorage` and `ModelRegistry` now default to `~/.pi/agent` paths unless you pass an `agentDir` ([#645](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/645))

### Added

- Glob pattern support with minimatch in package filters, top-level settings arrays, and pi manifest (e.g., `"!funky.json"`, `"*.ts"`) ([#645](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/645))
- `/reload` command to reload extensions, skills, prompts, and themes ([#645](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/645))
- `pi config` command with TUI to enable/disable package and top-level resources via patterns ([#938](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/938))
- CLI flags for `--skill`, `--prompt-template`, `--theme`, `--no-prompt-templates`, and `--no-themes` ([#645](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/645))

- Fixed compaction UI not showing when extensions trigger compaction.
- Fixed orphaned tool results after errored assistant messages causing Codex API errors. When an assistant message has `stopReason: "error"`, its tool calls are now excluded from pending tool tracking, preventing synthetic tool results from being generated for calls that will be dropped by provider-specific converters. ([#812](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/812))
- Fixed Bedrock Claude max_tokens handling to always exceed thinking budget tokens, preventing compaction failures. ([#797](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/797) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))
- Fixed Claude Code tool name normalization to match the Claude Code tool list case-insensitively and remove invalid mappings.

### Fixed

- Fixed crash during auto-compaction when summarization fails (e.g., quota exceeded). Now displays error message instead of crashing ([#792](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/792))
- Fixed `--session <UUID>` to search globally across projects if not found locally, with option to fork sessions from other projects ([#785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/785) by [@ribelo](https://github.com/ribelo))
- Fixed standalone binary WASM loading on Linux ([#784](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/784))
- Fixed string numbers in tool arguments not being coerced to numbers during validation ([#786](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/786) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Fixed `--no-extensions` flag not preventing extension discovery ([#776](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/776))
- Fixed extension messages rendering twice on startup when `pi.sendMessage({ display: true })` is called during `session_start` ([#765](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/765) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Fixed `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` env var not expanding tilde (`~`) to home directory ([#778](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/778) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- Fixed Bedrock tool call IDs causing API errors from invalid characters ([#781](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/781) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))

### Changed

- Hardware cursor is now disabled by default for better terminal compatibility. Set `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` to enable (replaces `PI_NO_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` which disabled it).

## [0.47.0] - 2026-01-16

### Breaking Changes

- Extensions using `Editor` directly must now pass `TUI` as the first constructor argument: `new Editor(tui, theme)`. The `tui` parameter is available in extension factory functions. ([#732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/732))

### Added

- **OpenAI Codex official support**: Full compatibility with OpenAI's Codex CLI models (`gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2-codex`). Features include static system prompt for OpenAI allowlisting, prompt caching via session ID, and reasoning signature retention across turns. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and use `--provider openai-codex` or select a Codex model. ([#737](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/737))
- `pi-internal://` URL scheme in read tool for accessing internal documentation. The model can read files from the coding-agent package (README, docs, examples) to learn about extending pi.
- New `input` event in extension system for intercepting, transforming, or handling user input before the agent processes it. Supports three result types: `continue` (pass through), `transform` (modify text/images), `handled` (respond without LLM). Handlers chain transforms and short-circuit on handled. ([#761](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/761) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Extension example: `input-transform.ts` demonstrating input interception patterns (quick mode, instant commands, source routing) ([#761](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/761) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Custom tool HTML export: extensions with `renderCall`/`renderResult` now render in `/share` and `/export` output with ANSI-to-HTML color conversion ([#702](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/702) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Direct filter shortcuts in Tree mode: Ctrl+D (default), Ctrl+T (no-tools), Ctrl+U (user-only), Ctrl+L (labeled-only), Ctrl+A (all) ([#747](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/747) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

### Changed

- Skill commands (`/skill:name`) are now expanded in AgentSession instead of interactive mode. This enables skill commands in RPC and print modes, and allows the `input` event to intercept `/skill:name` before expansion.

### Fixed

- Editor no longer corrupts terminal display when loading large prompts via `setEditorText`. Content now scrolls vertically with indicators showing lines above/below the viewport. ([#732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/732))
- Piped stdin now works correctly: `echo foo | pi` is equivalent to `pi -p foo`. When stdin is piped, print mode is automatically enabled since interactive mode requires a TTY ([#708](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/708))
- Session tree now preserves branch connectors and indentation when filters hide intermediate entries so descendants attach to the nearest visible ancestor and sibling branches align. Fixed in both TUI and HTML export ([#739](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/739) by [@w-winter](https://github.com/w-winter))
- Added `upstream connect`, `connection refused`, and `reset before headers` patterns to auto-retry error detection ([#733](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/733))
- Multi-line YAML frontmatter in skills and prompt templates now parses correctly. Centralized frontmatter parsing using the `yaml` library. ([#728](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/728) by [@richardgill](https://github.com/richardgill))
- `ctx.shutdown()` now waits for pending UI renders to complete before exiting, ensuring notifications and final output are visible ([#756](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/756))
- OpenAI Codex provider now retries on transient errors (429, 5xx, connection failures) with exponential backoff ([#733](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/733))

## [0.46.0] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- Scoped models (`--models` or `enabledModels`) now remember the last selected model across sessions instead of always starting with the first model in the scope ([#736](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/736) by [@ogulcancelik](https://github.com/ogulcancelik))
- Show `bun install` instead of `npm install` in update notification when running under Bun ([#714](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/714) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))

- Fixed signature support for non-Anthropic models in Amazon Bedrock provider ([#727](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/727) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, etc.) now work on non-Latin keyboard layouts (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc.) in terminals supporting Kitty keyboard protocol with alternate key reporting ([#718](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/718) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))

### Added

- Edit tool now uses fuzzy matching as fallback when exact match fails, tolerating trailing whitespace, smart quotes, Unicode dashes, and special spaces ([#713](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/713) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Support `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` to append instructions to the system prompt ([#716](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/716) by [@tallshort](https://github.com/tallshort))
- Session picker search: Ctrl+R toggles sorting between fuzzy match (default) and most recent; supports quoted phrase matching and `re:` regex mode ([#731](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/731) by [@ogulcancelik](https://github.com/ogulcancelik))
- Export `getAgentDir` for extensions ([#749](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/749) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))

- `gpt-5.2-codex` models for GitHub Copilot and OpenCode Zen providers ([#734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/734) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Changed

- Replaced `wasm-vips` with `@silvia-odwyer/photon-node` for image processing ([#710](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/710) by [@can1357](https://github.com/can1357))
- Extension example: `plan-mode/` shortcut changed from Shift+P to Ctrl+Alt+P to avoid conflict with typing capital P ([#746](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/746) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- UI keybinding hints now respect configured keybindings across components ([#724](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/724) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- CLI process title is now set to `pi` for easier process identification ([#742](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/742) by [@richardgill](https://github.com/richardgill))

- `ctx.ui.custom()` now accepts `onHandle` callback to receive the `OverlayHandle` for controlling overlay visibility ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Extension example: `overlay-qa-tests.ts` with 10 commands for testing overlay positioning, animation, and toggle scenarios ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Extension example: `doom-overlay/` - DOOM game running as an overlay at 35 FPS (auto-downloads WAD on first run) ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.45.5] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Skip changelog display on fresh install (only show on upgrades)

## [0.45.4] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- Light theme colors adjusted for WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast ratio against white backgrounds)
- Replaced `sharp` with `wasm-vips` for image processing (resize, PNG conversion). Eliminates native build requirements that caused installation failures on some systems. ([#696](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/696))

### Added

- Extension example: `summarize.ts` for summarizing conversations using custom UI and an external model ([#684](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/684) by [@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))

- Extension example: `questionnaire.ts` for multi-question input with tab bar navigation ([#695](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/695) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Experimental Vercel AI Gateway provider support: set `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and use `--provider vercel-ai-gateway`. Token usage is currently reported incorrectly by Anthropic Messages compatible endpoint. ([#689](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/689) by [@timolins](https://github.com/timolins))

### Fixed

- Fix API key resolution after model switches by using provider argument ([#691](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/691) by [@joshp123](https://github.com/joshp123))
- Fixed z.ai thinking/reasoning: thinking toggle now correctly enables/disables thinking for z.ai models ([#688](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/688))
- Fixed extension loading in compiled Bun binary: extensions with local file imports now work correctly. Updated `@mariozechner/jiti` to v2.6.5 which bundles babel for Bun binary compatibility. ([#681](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/681))
- Fixed theme loading when installed via mise: use wrapper directory in release tarballs for compatibility with mise's `strip_components=1` extraction. ([#681](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/681))

## [0.45.3] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.2] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Extensions now load correctly in compiled Bun binary using `@mariozechner/jiti` fork with `virtualModules` support. Bundled packages (`@sinclair/typebox`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`) are accessible to extensions without filesystem node_modules.

## [0.45.1] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- `/share` now outputs `buildwithpi.ai` session preview URLs instead of `pi.dev`

## [0.45.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- MiniMax provider support: set `MINIMAX_API_KEY` and use `minimax/MiniMax-M2.1` ([#656](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/656) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- `/scoped-models`: Alt+Up/Down to reorder enabled models. Order is preserved when saving with Ctrl+S and determines Ctrl+P cycling order. ([#676](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/676) by [@thomasmhr](https://github.com/thomasmhr))
- Amazon Bedrock provider support (experimental, tested with Anthropic Claude models only) ([#494](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/494) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))
- Extension example: `sandbox/` for OS-level bash sandboxing using `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` with per-project config ([#673](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/673) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Print mode JSON output now emits the session header as the first line.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-01-12

### Breaking Changes

- `pi.getAllTools()` now returns `ToolInfo[]` (with `name` and `description`) instead of `string[]`. Extensions that only need names can use `.map(t => t.name)`. ([#648](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/648) by [@carsonfarmer](https://github.com/carsonfarmer))

### Added

- Session naming: `/name <name>` command sets a display name shown in the session selector instead of the first message. Useful for distinguishing forked sessions. Extensions can use `pi.setSessionName()` and `pi.getSessionName()`. ([#650](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/650) by [@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))
- Extension example: `notify.ts` for desktop notifications via OSC 777 escape sequence ([#658](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/658) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))

- Fuzzy search in `/settings` menu: type to filter settings by label ([#643](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/643) by [@ninlds](https://github.com/ninlds))

### Fixed

- Session selector now stays open when current folder has no sessions, allowing Tab to switch to "all" scope ([#661](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/661) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- Extensions using theme utilities like `getSettingsListTheme()` now work in dev mode with tsx

## [0.43.0] - 2026-01-11

### Breaking Changes

- Extension editor (`ctx.ui.editor()`) now uses Enter to submit and Shift+Enter for newlines, matching the main editor. Previously used Ctrl+Enter to submit. Extensions with hardcoded "ctrl+enter" hints need updating. ([#642](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/642) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Renamed `/branch` command to `/fork` ([#641](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/641))
  - RPC: `branch` → `fork`, `get_branch_messages` → `get_fork_messages`
  - SDK: `branch()` → `fork()`, `getBranchMessages()` → `getForkMessages()`
  - AgentSession: `branch()` → `fork()`, `getUserMessagesForBranching()` → `getUserMessagesForForking()`
  - Extension events: `session_before_branch` → `session_before_fork`, `session_branch` → `session_fork`
  - Settings: `doubleEscapeAction: "branch" | "tree"` → `"fork" | "tree"`
- `SessionManager.list()` and `SessionManager.listAll()` are now async, returning `Promise<SessionInfo[]>`. Callers must await them. ([#620](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/620) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))

### Added
- `/resume` selector now toggles between current-folder and all sessions with Tab, showing the session cwd in the All view and loading progress. ([#620](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/620) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- `SessionManager.list()` and `SessionManager.listAll()` accept optional `onProgress` callback for progress updates
- `SessionInfo.cwd` field containing the session's working directory (empty string for old sessions)
- `SessionListProgress` type export for progress callbacks
- `/scoped-models` command to enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling. Changes are session-only by default; press Ctrl+S to persist to settings.json. ([#626](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/626) by [@CarlosGtrz](https://github.com/CarlosGtrz))
- `model_select` extension hook fires when model changes via `/model`, model cycling, or session restore with `source` field and `previousModel` ([#628](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/628) by [@marckrenn](https://github.com/marckrenn))
- `ctx.ui.setWorkingMessage()` extension API to customize the "Working..." message during streaming ([#625](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/625) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Skill slash commands: loaded skills are registered as `/skill:name` commands for quick access. Toggle via `/settings` or `skills.enableSkillCommands` in settings.json. ([#630](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/630) by [@Dwsy](https://github.com/Dwsy))
- Slash command autocomplete now uses fuzzy matching (type `/skbra` to match `/skill:brave-search`)
- `/tree` branch summarization now offers three options: "No summary", "Summarize", and "Summarize with custom prompt". Custom prompts are appended as additional focus to the default summarization instructions. ([#642](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/642) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

### Fixed

- Missing spacer between assistant message and text editor ([#655](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/655))
- Session picker respects custom keybindings when using `--resume` ([#633](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/633) by [@aos](https://github.com/aos))
- Custom footer extensions now see model changes: `ctx.model` is now a getter that returns the current model instead of a snapshot from when the context was created ([#634](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/634) by [@ogulcancelik](https://github.com/ogulcancelik))
- Footer git branch not updating after external branch switches. Git uses atomic writes (temp file + rename), which changes the inode and breaks `fs.watch` on the file. Now watches the directory instead.
- Extension loading errors are now displayed to the user instead of being silently ignored ([#639](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/639) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.42.5] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- Reduced flicker by only re-rendering changed lines ([#617](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/617) by [@ogulcancelik](https://github.com/ogulcancelik)). No worries tho, there's still a little flicker in the VS Code Terminal. Praise the flicker.
- Cursor position tracking when content shrinks with unchanged remaining lines
- TUI renders with wrong dimensions after suspend/resume if terminal was resized while suspended ([#599](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/599))
- Pasted content containing Kitty key release patterns (e.g., `:3F` in MAC addresses) was incorrectly filtered out ([#623](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/623) by [@ogulcancelik](https://github.com/ogulcancelik))

## [0.42.4] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed

- Bash output expanded hint now says "(ctrl+o to collapse)" ([#610](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/610) by [@tallshort](https://github.com/tallshort))
- Fixed UTF-8 text corruption in remote bash execution (SSH, containers) by using streaming TextDecoder ([#608](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/608))

## [0.42.3] - 2026-01-10

### Changed

- OpenAI Codex: updated to use bundled system prompt from upstream

## [0.42.2] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- `/model <search>` now pre-filters the model selector or auto-selects on exact match. Use `provider/model` syntax to disambiguate (e.g., `/model openai/gpt-4`). ([#587](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/587) by [@zedrdave](https://github.com/zedrdave))
- `FooterDataProvider` for custom footers: `ctx.ui.setFooter()` now receives a third `footerData` parameter providing `getGitBranch()`, `getExtensionStatuses()`, and `onBranchChange()` for reactive updates ([#600](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/600) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- `Alt+Up` hotkey to restore queued steering/follow-up messages back into the editor without aborting the current run ([#604](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/604) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))

### Fixed

- Symlinked directories in `prompts/` folders are now followed when loading prompt templates ([#601](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/601) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.42.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Added OpenCode Zen provider support. Set `OPENCODE_API_KEY` env var and use `opencode/<model-id>` (e.g., `opencode/claude-opus-4-5`).

## [0.41.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Anthropic OAuth support is back! Use `/login` to authenticate with your Claude Pro/Max subscription.

## [0.40.1] - 2026-01-09

### Removed

- Anthropic OAuth support (`/login`). Use API keys instead.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- Documentation on component invalidation and theme changes in `docs/tui.md`

### Fixed

- Components now properly rebuild their content on theme change (tool executions, assistant messages, bash executions, custom messages, branch/compaction summaries)

## [0.39.1] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- `setTheme()` now triggers a full rerender so previously rendered components update with the new theme colors
- `mac-system-theme.ts` example now polls every 2 seconds and uses `osascript` for real-time macOS appearance detection

## [0.39.0] - 2026-01-08

### Breaking Changes

- `before_agent_start` event now receives `systemPrompt` in the event object and returns `systemPrompt` (full replacement) instead of `systemPromptAppend`. Extensions that were appending must now use `event.systemPrompt + extra` pattern. ([#575](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/575))
- `discoverSkills()` now returns `{ skills: Skill[], warnings: SkillWarning[] }` instead of `Skill[]`. This allows callers to handle skill loading warnings. ([#577](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/577) by [@cv](https://github.com/cv))

### Added

- `ctx.ui.getAllThemes()`, `ctx.ui.getTheme(name)`, and `ctx.ui.setTheme(name | Theme)` methods for extensions to list, load, and switch themes at runtime ([#576](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/576))
- `--no-tools` flag to disable all built-in tools, allowing extension-only tool setups ([#557](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/557) by [@cv](https://github.com/cv))
- Pluggable operations for built-in tools enabling remote execution via SSH or other transports ([#564](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/564)). Interfaces: `ReadOperations`, `WriteOperations`, `EditOperations`, `BashOperations`, `LsOperations`, `GrepOperations`, `FindOperations`
- `user_bash` event for intercepting user `!`/`!!` commands, allowing extensions to redirect to remote systems ([#528](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/528))
- `setActiveTools()` in ExtensionAPI for dynamic tool management
- Built-in renderers used automatically for tool overrides without custom `renderCall`/`renderResult`

- Wayland clipboard support for `/copy` command using wl-copy with xclip/xsel fallback ([#570](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/570) by [@OgulcanCelik](https://github.com/OgulcanCelik))
- **Experimental:** `ctx.ui.custom()` now accepts `{ overlay: true }` option for floating modal components that composite over existing content without clearing the screen ([#558](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/558) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- `AgentSession.skills` and `AgentSession.skillWarnings` properties to access loaded skills without rediscovery ([#577](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/577) by [@cv](https://github.com/cv))

### Fixed

- String `systemPrompt` in `createAgentSession()` now works as a full replacement instead of having context files and skills appended, matching documented behavior ([#543](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/543))
- Update notification for bun binary installs now shows release download URL instead of npm command ([#567](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/567) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- ESC key now works during "Working..." state after auto-retry ([#568](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/568) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Abort messages now show correct retry attempt count (e.g., "Aborted after 2 retry attempts") ([#568](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/568) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed Antigravity provider returning 429 errors despite available quota ([#571](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/571) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas))
- Fixed malformed thinking text in Gemini/Antigravity responses where thinking content appeared as regular text or vice versa. Cross-model conversations now properly convert thinking blocks to plain text. ([#561](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/561))
- `--no-skills` flag now correctly prevents skills from loading in interactive mode ([#577](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/577) by [@cv](https://github.com/cv))

## [0.38.0] - 2026-01-08

- `ExtensionRunner.getHasUI()` renamed to `hasUI()`
- OpenAI Codex model aliases removed (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `codex-mini-latest`). Use canonical IDs: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))

### Added

- `--no-extensions` flag to disable extension discovery while still allowing explicit `-e` paths ([#524](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/524) by [@cv](https://github.com/cv))
- SDK: `InteractiveMode`, `runPrintMode()`, `runRpcMode()` exported for building custom run modes. See `docs/sdk.md`.
- `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` environment variable to disable new version notifications at startup ([#549](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/549) by [@aos](https://github.com/aos))
- `thinkingBudgets` setting to customize token budgets per thinking level for token-based providers ([#529](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/529) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))
- Extension UI dialogs (`ctx.ui.select()`, `ctx.ui.confirm()`, `ctx.ui.input()`) now support a `timeout` option with live countdown display ([#522](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/522) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- Extensions can now provide custom editor components via `ctx.ui.setEditorComponent()`. See `examples/extensions/modal-editor.ts` and `docs/tui.md` Pattern 7.
- Extension factories can now be async, enabling dynamic imports and lazy-loaded dependencies ([#513](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/513) by [@austinm911](https://github.com/austinm911))
- `ctx.shutdown()` is now available in extension contexts for requesting a graceful shutdown. In interactive mode, shutdown is deferred until the agent becomes idle (after processing all queued steering and follow-up messages). In RPC mode, shutdown is deferred until after completing the current command response. In print mode, shutdown is a no-op as the process exits automatically when prompts complete. ([#542](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/542) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

### Fixed

- Default thinking level from settings now applies correctly when `enabledModels` is configured ([#540](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/540) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- External edits to `settings.json` while pi is running are now preserved when pi saves settings ([#527](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/527) by [@ferologics](https://github.com/ferologics))
- Overflow-based compaction now skips if error came from a different model or was already handled by a previous compaction ([#535](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/535) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- OpenAI Codex context window reduced from 400k to 272k tokens to match Codex CLI defaults and prevent 400 errors ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))
- Context overflow detection now recognizes `context_length_exceeded` errors.
- Key presses no longer dropped when input is batched over SSH ([#538](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/538))
- Clipboard image support now works on Alpine Linux and other musl-based distros ([#533](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/533))

### Fixed

- Messages submitted during compaction are queued and delivered after compaction completes, preserving steering and follow-up behavior. Extension commands execute immediately during compaction. ([#476](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/476) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Managed binaries (`fd`, `rg`) now stored in `~/.pi/agent/bin/` instead of `tools/`, eliminating false deprecation warnings ([#470](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/470) by [@mcinteerj](https://github.com/mcinteerj))

## [0.35.0] - 2026-01-05

This release unifies hooks and custom tools into a single "extensions" system and renames "slash commands" to "prompt templates". ([#454](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/454))

**Before migrating, read:**

- [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) - Full API reference
- [README.md](README.md) - Extensions section with examples
- [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/) - Working examples

### Extensions Migration

Hooks and custom tools are now unified as **extensions**. Both were TypeScript modules exporting a factory function that receives an API object. Now there's one concept, one discovery location, one CLI flag, one settings.json entry.

**Automatic migration:**

- `commands/` directories are automatically renamed to `prompts/` on startup (both `~/.pi/agent/commands/` and `.pi/commands/`)

**Manual migration required:**

1. Move files from `hooks/` and `tools/` directories to `extensions/` (deprecation warnings shown on startup)
2. Update imports and type names in your extension code
3. Update `settings.json` if you have explicit hook and custom tool paths configured

**Directory changes:**

```
# Before
~/.pi/agent/hooks/*.ts       →  ~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts
~/.pi/agent/tools/*.ts       →  ~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts
.pi/hooks/*.ts               →  .pi/extensions/*.ts
.pi/tools/*.ts               →  .pi/extensions/*.ts
```

**Extension discovery rules** (in `extensions/` directories):

1. **Direct files:** `extensions/*.ts` or `*.js` → loaded directly
2. **Subdirectory with index:** `extensions/myext/index.ts` → loaded as single extension
3. **Subdirectory with package.json:** `extensions/myext/package.json` with `"pi"` field → loads declared paths

```json
// extensions/my-package/package.json
{
  "name": "my-extension-package",
  "dependencies": { "zod": "^3.0.0" },
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./src/main.ts", "./src/tools.ts"]
  }
}
```

No recursion beyond one level. Complex packages must use the `package.json` manifest. Dependencies are resolved via jiti, and extensions can be published to and installed from npm.

**Type renames:**

- `HookAPI` → `ExtensionAPI`
- `HookContext` → `ExtensionContext`
- `HookCommandContext` → `ExtensionCommandContext`
- `HookUIContext` → `ExtensionUIContext`
- `CustomToolAPI` → `ExtensionAPI` (merged)
- `CustomToolContext` → `ExtensionContext` (merged)
- `CustomToolUIContext` → `ExtensionUIContext`
- `CustomTool` → `ToolDefinition`
- `CustomToolFactory` → `ExtensionFactory`
- `HookMessage` → `CustomMessage`

**Import changes:**

```typescript
// Before (hook)
import type { HookAPI, HookContext } from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";
export default function (pi: HookAPI) { ... }

// Before (custom tool)
import type { CustomToolFactory } from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";
const factory: CustomToolFactory = (pi) => ({ name: "my_tool", ... });
export default factory;

// After (both are now extensions)
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";
export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  pi.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
  pi.registerTool({ name: "my_tool", ... });
}
```

**Custom tools now have full context access.** Tools registered via `pi.registerTool()` now receive the same `ctx` object that event handlers receive. Previously, custom tools had limited context. Now all extension code shares the same capabilities:

- `pi.registerTool()` - Register tools the LLM can call
- `pi.registerCommand()` - Register commands like `/mycommand`
- `pi.registerShortcut()` - Register keyboard shortcuts (shown in `/hotkeys`)
- `pi.registerFlag()` - Register CLI flags (shown in `--help`)
- `pi.registerMessageRenderer()` - Custom TUI rendering for message types
- `pi.on()` - Subscribe to lifecycle events (tool_call, session_start, etc.)
- `pi.sendMessage()` - Inject messages into the conversation
- `pi.appendEntry()` - Persist custom data in session (survives restart/branch)
- `pi.exec()` - Run shell commands
- `pi.getActiveTools()` / `pi.setActiveTools()` - Dynamic tool enable/disable
- `pi.getAllTools()` - List all available tools
- `pi.events` - Event bus for cross-extension communication
- `ctx.ui.confirm()` / `select()` / `input()` - User prompts
- `ctx.ui.notify()` - Toast notifications
- `ctx.ui.setStatus()` - Persistent status in footer (multiple extensions can set their own)
- `ctx.ui.setWidget()` - Widget display above editor
- `ctx.ui.setTitle()` - Set terminal window title
- `ctx.ui.custom()` - Full TUI component with keyboard handling
- `ctx.ui.editor()` - Multi-line text editor with external editor support
- `ctx.sessionManager` - Read session entries, get branch history

**Settings changes:**

```json
// Before
{
  "hooks": ["./my-hook.ts"],
  "customTools": ["./my-tool.ts"]
}

// After
{
  "extensions": ["./my-extension.ts"]
}
```

**CLI changes:**

```bash
# Before
pi --hook ./safety.ts --tool ./todo.ts

# After
pi --extension ./safety.ts -e ./todo.ts
```

### Prompt Templates Migration

"Slash commands" (markdown files defining reusable prompts invoked via `/name`) are renamed to "prompt templates" to avoid confusion with extension-registered commands.

**Automatic migration:** The `commands/` directory is automatically renamed to `prompts/` on startup (if `prompts/` doesn't exist). Works for both regular directories and symlinks.

**Directory changes:**

```
~/.pi/agent/commands/*.md    →  ~/.pi/agent/prompts/*.md
.pi/commands/*.md            →  .pi/prompts/*.md
```

**SDK type renames:**

- `FileSlashCommand` → `PromptTemplate`
- `LoadSlashCommandsOptions` → `LoadPromptTemplatesOptions`

**SDK function renames:**

- `discoverSlashCommands()` → `discoverPromptTemplates()`
- `loadSlashCommands()` → `loadPromptTemplates()`
- `expandSlashCommand()` → `expandPromptTemplate()`
- `getCommandsDir()` → `getPromptsDir()`

**SDK option renames:**

- `CreateAgentSessionOptions.slashCommands` → `.promptTemplates`
- `AgentSession.fileCommands` → `.promptTemplates`
- `PromptOptions.expandSlashCommands` → `.expandPromptTemplates`

### SDK Migration

**Discovery functions:**

- `discoverAndLoadHooks()` → `discoverAndLoadExtensions()`
- `discoverAndLoadCustomTools()` → merged into `discoverAndLoadExtensions()`
- `loadHooks()` → `loadExtensions()`
- `loadCustomTools()` → merged into `loadExtensions()`

**Runner and wrapper:**

- `HookRunner` → `ExtensionRunner`
- `wrapToolsWithHooks()` → `wrapToolsWithExtensions()`
- `wrapToolWithHooks()` → `wrapToolWithExtensions()`

**CreateAgentSessionOptions:**

- `.hooks` → removed (use `.additionalExtensionPaths` for paths)
- `.additionalHookPaths` → `.additionalExtensionPaths`
- `.preloadedHooks` → `.preloadedExtensions`
- `.customTools` type changed: `Array<{ path?; tool: CustomTool }>` → `ToolDefinition[]`
- `.additionalCustomToolPaths` → merged into `.additionalExtensionPaths`
- `.slashCommands` → `.promptTemplates`

**AgentSession:**

- `.hookRunner` → `.extensionRunner`
- `.fileCommands` → `.promptTemplates`
- `.sendHookMessage()` → `.sendCustomMessage()`

### Session Migration

**Automatic.** Session version bumped from 2 to 3. Existing sessions are migrated on first load:

- Message role `"hookMessage"` → `"custom"`

### Breaking Changes

- **Settings:** `hooks` and `customTools` arrays replaced with single `extensions` array
- **CLI:** `--hook` and `--tool` flags replaced with `--extension` / `-e`
- **Directories:** `hooks/`, `tools/` → `extensions/`; `commands/` → `prompts/`
- **Types:** See type renames above
- **SDK:** See SDK migration above

### Changed

- Extensions can have their own `package.json` with dependencies (resolved via jiti)
- Documentation: `docs/hooks.md` and `docs/custom-tools.md` merged into `docs/extensions.md`
- Examples: `examples/hooks/` and `examples/custom-tools/` merged into `examples/extensions/`
- README: Extensions section expanded with custom tools, commands, events, state persistence, shortcuts, flags, and UI examples
- SDK: `customTools` option now accepts `ToolDefinition[]` directly (simplified from `Array<{ path?, tool }>`)
- SDK: `extensions` option accepts `ExtensionFactory[]` for inline extensions
- SDK: `additionalExtensionPaths` replaces both `additionalHookPaths` and `additionalCustomToolPaths`

## [0.34.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- Hook API: `ctx.ui.setTitle(title)` allows hooks to set the terminal window/tab title ([#446](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/446) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

### Changed

- Expanded keybinding documentation to list all 32 supported symbol keys with notes on ctrl+symbol behavior ([#450](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/450) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

## [0.34.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- Hook API: `pi.getActiveTools()` and `pi.setActiveTools(toolNames)` for dynamically enabling/disabling tools from hooks
- Hook API: `pi.getAllTools()` to enumerate all configured tools (built-in via --tools or default, plus custom tools)
- Hook API: `pi.registerFlag(name, options)` and `pi.getFlag(name)` for hooks to register custom CLI flags (parsed automatically)
- Hook API: `pi.registerShortcut(shortcut, options)` for hooks to register custom keyboard shortcuts using `KeyId` (e.g., `Key.shift("p")`). Conflicts with built-in shortcuts are skipped, conflicts between hooks logged as warnings.
- Hook API: `ctx.ui.setWidget(key, content)` for status displays above the editor. Accepts either a string array or a component factory function.
- Hook API: `theme.strikethrough(text)` for strikethrough text styling
- Hook API: `before_agent_start` handlers can now return `systemPromptAppend` to dynamically append text to the system prompt for that turn. Multiple hooks' appends are concatenated.
- Hook API: `before_agent_start` handlers can now return multiple messages (all are injected, not just the first)
- `/hotkeys` command now shows hook-registered shortcuts in a separate "Hooks" section
- New example hook: `plan-mode.ts` - Claude Code-style read-only exploration mode:
  - Toggle via `/plan` command, `Shift+P` shortcut, or `--plan` CLI flag
  - Read-only tools: `read`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` (no `edit`/`write`)
  - Bash commands restricted to non-destructive operations (blocks `rm`, `mv`, `git commit`, `npm install`, etc.)
  - Interactive prompt after each response: execute plan, stay in plan mode, or refine
  - Todo list widget showing progress with checkboxes and strikethrough for completed items
  - Each todo has a unique ID; agent marks items done by outputting `[DONE:id]`
  - Progress updates via `agent_end` hook (parses completed items from final message)
  - `/todos` command to view current plan progress
  - Shows `⏸ plan` indicator in footer when in plan mode, `📋 2/5` when executing
  - State persists across sessions (including todo progress)
- New example hook: `tools.ts` - Interactive `/tools` command to enable/disable tools with session persistence
- New example hook: `pirate.ts` - Demonstrates `systemPromptAppend` to make the agent speak like a pirate
- Tool registry now contains all built-in tools (read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls) even when `--tools` limits the initially active set. Hooks can enable any tool from the registry via `pi.setActiveTools()`.
- System prompt now automatically rebuilds when tools change via `setActiveTools()`, updating tool descriptions and guidelines to match the new tool set
- Hook errors now display full stack traces for easier debugging
- Event bus (`pi.events`) for tool/hook communication: shared pub/sub between custom tools and hooks
- Custom tools now have `pi.sendMessage()` to send messages directly to the agent session without needing the event bus
- `sendMessage()` supports `deliverAs: "nextTurn"` to queue messages for the next user prompt

### Changed

- Removed image placeholders after copy & paste, replaced with inserting image file paths directly. ([#442](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/442) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

### Fixed

- Fixed potential text decoding issues in bash executor by using streaming TextDecoder instead of Buffer.toString()
- External editor (Ctrl-G) now shows full pasted content instead of `[paste #N ...]` placeholders ([#444](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/444) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-04

### Breaking Changes

- **Key detection functions removed from `@mariozechner/pi-tui`**: All `isXxx()` key detection functions (`isEnter()`, `isEscape()`, `isCtrlC()`, etc.) have been removed. Use `matchesKey(data, keyId)` instead (e.g., `matchesKey(data, "enter")`, `matchesKey(data, "ctrl+c")`). This affects hooks and custom tools that use `ctx.ui.custom()` with keyboard input handling. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405))

### Added

- Clipboard image paste support via `Ctrl+V`. Images are saved to a temp file and attached to the message. Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux (X11). ([#419](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/419))
- Configurable keybindings via `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`. All keyboard shortcuts (editor navigation, deletion, app actions like model cycling, etc.) can now be customized. Supports multiple bindings per action. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405) by [@hjanuschka](https://github.com/hjanuschka))
- `/quit` and `/exit` slash commands to gracefully exit the application. Unlike double Ctrl+C, these properly await hook and custom tool cleanup handlers before exiting. ([#426](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/426) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas))

### Fixed

- Subagent example README referenced incorrect filename `subagent.ts` instead of `index.ts` ([#427](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/427) by [@Whamp](https://github.com/Whamp))

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- `--list-models` no longer shows Google Vertex AI models without explicit authentication configured
- JPEG/GIF/WebP images not displaying in terminals using Kitty graphics protocol (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm). The protocol requires PNG format, so non-PNG images are now converted before display.
- Version check URL typo preventing update notifications from working ([#423](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/423) by [@skuridin](https://github.com/skuridin))
- Large images exceeding Anthropic's 5MB limit now retry with progressive quality/size reduction ([#424](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/424) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.32.2] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- `$ARGUMENTS` syntax for custom slash commands as alternative to `$@` for all arguments joined. Aligns with patterns used by Claude, Codex, and OpenCode. Both syntaxes remain fully supported. ([#418](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/418) by [@skuridin](https://github.com/skuridin))

### Changed

- **Slash commands and hook commands now work during streaming**: Previously, using a slash command or hook command while the agent was streaming would crash with "Agent is already processing". Now:
  - Hook commands execute immediately (they manage their own LLM interaction via `pi.sendMessage()`)
  - File-based slash commands are expanded and queued via steer/followUp
  - `steer()` and `followUp()` now expand file-based slash commands and error on hook commands (hook commands cannot be queued)
  - `prompt()` accepts new `streamingBehavior` option (`"steer"` or `"followUp"`) to specify queueing behavior during streaming
  - RPC `prompt` command now accepts optional `streamingBehavior` field
    ([#420](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/420))

### Fixed

- Slash command argument substitution now processes positional arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) before all-arguments (`$@`, `$ARGUMENTS`) to prevent recursive substitution when argument values contain dollar-digit patterns like `$100`. ([#418](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/418) by [@skuridin](https://github.com/skuridin))

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Shell commands without context contribution: use `!!command` to execute a bash command that is shown in the TUI and saved to session history but excluded from LLM context. Useful for running commands you don't want the AI to see. ([#414](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/414))

### Fixed

- Edit tool diff not displaying in TUI due to race condition between async preview computation and tool execution

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Breaking Changes

- **Queue API replaced with steer/followUp**: The `queueMessage()` method has been split into two methods with different delivery semantics ([#403](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/403)):
  - `steer(text)`: Interrupts the agent mid-run (Enter while streaming). Delivered after current tool execution.
  - `followUp(text)`: Waits until the agent finishes (Alt+Enter while streaming). Delivered only when agent stops.
- **Settings renamed**: `queueMode` setting renamed to `steeringMode`. Added new `followUpMode` setting. Old settings.json files are migrated automatically.
- **AgentSession methods renamed**:
  - `queueMessage()` → `steer()` and `followUp()`
  - `queueMode` getter → `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` getters
  - `setQueueMode()` → `setSteeringMode()` and `setFollowUpMode()`
  - `queuedMessageCount` → `pendingMessageCount`
  - `getQueuedMessages()` → `getSteeringMessages()` and `getFollowUpMessages()`
  - `clearQueue()` now returns `{ steering: string[], followUp: string[] }`
  - `hasQueuedMessages()` → `hasPendingMessages()`
- **Hook API signature changed**: `pi.sendMessage()` second parameter changed from `triggerTurn?: boolean` to `options?: { triggerTurn?, deliverAs? }`. Use `deliverAs: "followUp"` for follow-up delivery. Affects both hooks and internal `sendHookMessage()` method.
- **RPC API changes**:
  - `queue_message` command → `steer` and `follow_up` commands
  - `set_queue_mode` command → `set_steering_mode` and `set_follow_up_mode` commands
  - `RpcSessionState.queueMode` → `steeringMode` and `followUpMode`
- **Settings UI**: "Queue mode" setting split into "Steering mode" and "Follow-up mode"

### Added

- Configurable double-escape action: choose whether double-escape with empty editor opens `/tree` (default) or `/branch`. Configure via `/settings` or `doubleEscapeAction` in settings.json ([#404](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/404))
- Vertex AI provider (`google-vertex`): access Gemini models via Google Cloud Vertex AI using Application Default Credentials ([#300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/300) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))
- Built-in provider overrides in `models.json`: override just `baseUrl` to route a built-in provider through a proxy while keeping all its models, or define `models` to fully replace the provider ([#406](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/406) by [@yevhen](https://github.com/yevhen))
- Automatic image resizing: images larger than 2000x2000 are resized for better model compatibility. Original dimensions are injected into the prompt. Controlled via `/settings` or `images.autoResize` in settings.json. ([#402](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/402) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Alt+Enter keybind to queue follow-up messages while agent is streaming
- `Theme` and `ThemeColor` types now exported for hooks using `ctx.ui.custom()`
- Terminal window title now displays "pi - dirname" to identify which project session you're in ([#407](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/407) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

### Changed

- Editor component now uses word wrapping instead of character-level wrapping for better readability ([#382](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/382) by [@nickseelert](https://github.com/nickseelert))

### Fixed

- `/model` selector now opens instantly instead of waiting for OAuth token refresh. Token refresh is deferred until a model is actually used.
- Shift+Space, Shift+Backspace, and Shift+Delete now work correctly in Kitty-protocol terminals (Kitty, WezTerm, etc.) instead of being silently ignored ([#411](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/411) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))
- `AgentSession.prompt()` now throws if called while the agent is already streaming, preventing race conditions. Use `steer()` or `followUp()` to queue messages during streaming.
- Ctrl+C now works like Escape in selector components, so mashing Ctrl+C will eventually close the program ([#400](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/400) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- Model selector no longer allows negative index when pressing arrow keys before models finish loading ([#398](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/398) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Type guard functions (`isBashToolResult`, etc.) now exported at runtime, not just in type declarations ([#397](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/397))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

This release introduces session trees for in-place branching, major API changes to hooks and custom tools, and structured compaction with file tracking.

### Session Tree

Sessions now use a tree structure with `id`/`parentId` fields. This enables in-place branching: navigate to any previous point with `/tree`, continue from there, and switch between branches while preserving all history in a single file.

**Existing sessions are automatically migrated** (v1 → v2) on first load. No manual action required.

New entry types: `BranchSummaryEntry` (context from abandoned branches), `CustomEntry` (hook state), `CustomMessageEntry` (hook-injected messages), `LabelEntry` (bookmarks).

See [docs/session.md](docs/session.md) for the file format and `SessionManager` API.

### Hooks Migration

The hooks API has been restructured with more granular events and better session access.

**Type renames:**

- `HookEventContext` → `HookContext`
- `HookCommandContext` is now a new interface extending `HookContext` with session control methods

**Event changes:**

- The monolithic `session` event is now split into granular events: `session_start`, `session_before_switch`, `session_switch`, `session_before_branch`, `session_branch`, `session_before_compact`, `session_compact`, `session_shutdown`
- `session_before_switch` and `session_switch` events now include `reason: "new" | "resume"` to distinguish between `/new` and `/resume`
- New `session_before_tree` and `session_tree` events for `/tree` navigation (hook can provide custom branch summary)
- New `before_agent_start` event: inject messages before the agent loop starts
- New `context` event: modify messages non-destructively before each LLM call
- Session entries are no longer passed in events. Use `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` or `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` instead

**API changes:**

- `pi.send(text, attachments?)` → `pi.sendMessage(message, triggerTurn?)` (creates `CustomMessageEntry`)
- New `pi.appendEntry(customType, data?)` for hook state persistence (not in LLM context)
- New `pi.registerCommand(name, options)` for custom slash commands (handler receives `HookCommandContext`)
- New `pi.registerMessageRenderer(customType, renderer)` for custom TUI rendering
- New `ctx.isIdle()`, `ctx.abort()`, `ctx.hasQueuedMessages()` for agent state (available in all events)
- New `ctx.ui.editor(title, prefill?)` for multi-line text editing with Ctrl+G external editor support
- New `ctx.ui.custom(component)` for full TUI component rendering with keyboard focus
- New `ctx.ui.setStatus(key, text)` for persistent status text in footer (multiple hooks can set their own)
- New `ctx.ui.theme` getter for styling text with theme colors
- `ctx.exec()` moved to `pi.exec()`
- `ctx.sessionFile` → `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionFile()`
- New `ctx.modelRegistry` and `ctx.model` for API key resolution

**HookCommandContext (slash commands only):**

- `ctx.waitForIdle()` - wait for agent to finish streaming
- `ctx.newSession(options?)` - create new sessions with optional setup callback
- `ctx.fork(entryId) - fork from a specific entry, creating a new session file
- `ctx.navigateTree(targetId, options?)` - navigate the session tree

These methods are only on `HookCommandContext` (not `HookContext`) because they can deadlock if called from event handlers that run inside the agent loop.

**Removed:**

- `hookTimeout` setting (hooks no longer have timeouts; use Ctrl+C to abort)
- `resolveApiKey` parameter (use `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKey(model)`)

See [docs/hooks.md](docs/hooks.md) and [examples/hooks/](examples/hooks/) for the current API.

### Custom Tools Migration

The custom tools API has been restructured to mirror the hooks pattern with a context object.

**Type renames:**

- `CustomAgentTool` → `CustomTool`
- `ToolAPI` → `CustomToolAPI`
- `ToolContext` → `CustomToolContext`
- `ToolSessionEvent` → `CustomToolSessionEvent`

**Execute signature changed:**

```typescript
// Before (v0.30.2)
execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate)

// After
execute(toolCallId, params, onUpdate, ctx, signal?)
```

The new `ctx: CustomToolContext` provides `sessionManager`, `modelRegistry`, `model`, and agent state methods:

- `ctx.isIdle()` - check if agent is streaming
- `ctx.hasQueuedMessages()` - check if user has queued messages (skip interactive prompts)
- `ctx.abort()` - abort current operation (fire-and-forget)

**Session event changes:**

- `CustomToolSessionEvent` now only has `reason` and `previousSessionFile`
- Session entries are no longer in the event. Use `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` or `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` to reconstruct state
- Reasons: `"start" | "switch" | "branch" | "tree" | "shutdown"` (no separate `"new"` reason; `/new` triggers `"switch"`)
- `dispose()` method removed. Use `onSession` with `reason: "shutdown"` for cleanup

See [docs/custom-tools.md](docs/custom-tools.md) and [examples/custom-tools/](examples/custom-tools/) for the current API.

### SDK Migration

**Type changes:**

- `CustomAgentTool` → `CustomTool`
- `AppMessage` → `AgentMessage`
- `sessionFile` returns `string | undefined` (was `string | null`)
- `model` returns `Model | undefined` (was `Model | null`)
- `Attachment` type removed. Use `ImageContent` from `@mariozechner/pi-ai` instead. Add images directly to message content arrays.

**AgentSession API:**

- `branch(entryIndex: number)` → `branch(entryId: string)`
- `getUserMessagesForBranching()` returns `{ entryId, text }` instead of `{ entryIndex, text }`
- `reset()` → `newSession(options?)` where options has optional `parentSession` for lineage tracking
- `newSession()` and `switchSession()` now return `Promise<boolean>` (false if cancelled by hook)
- New `navigateTree(targetId, options?)` for in-place tree navigation

**Hook integration:**

- New `sendHookMessage(message, triggerTurn?)` for hook message injection

**SessionManager API:**

- Method renames: `saveXXX()` → `appendXXX()` (e.g., `appendMessage`, `appendCompaction`)
- `branchInPlace()` → `branch()`
- `reset()` → `newSession(options?)` with optional `parentSession` for lineage tracking
- `createBranchedSessionFromEntries(entries, index)` → `createBranchedSession(leafId)`
- `SessionHeader.branchedFrom` → `SessionHeader.parentSession`
- `saveCompaction(entry)` → `appendCompaction(summary, firstKeptEntryId, tokensBefore, details?)`
- `getEntries()` now excludes the session header (use `getHeader()` separately)
- `getSessionFile()` returns `string | undefined` (undefined for in-memory sessions)
- New tree methods: `getTree()`, `getBranch()`, `getLeafId()`, `getLeafEntry()`, `getEntry()`, `getChildren()`, `getLabel()`
- New append methods: `appendCustomEntry()`, `appendCustomMessageEntry()`, `appendLabelChange()`
- New branch methods: `branch(entryId)`, `branchWithSummary()`

**ModelRegistry (new):**

`ModelRegistry` is a new class that manages model discovery and API key resolution. It combines built-in models with custom models from `models.json` and resolves API keys via `AuthStorage`.

```typescript
import {
  discoverAuthStorage,
  discoverModels,
} from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";

const authStorage = discoverAuthStorage(); // ~/.pi/agent/auth.json
const modelRegistry = discoverModels(authStorage); // + ~/.pi/agent/models.json

// Get all models (built-in + custom)
const allModels = modelRegistry.getAll();

// Get only models with valid API keys
const available = await modelRegistry.getAvailable();

// Find specific model
const model = modelRegistry.find("anthropic", "claude-sonnet-4-20250514");

// Get API key for a model
const apiKey = await modelRegistry.getApiKey(model);
```

This replaces the old `resolveApiKey` callback pattern. Hooks and custom tools access it via `ctx.modelRegistry`.

**Renamed exports:**

- `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
- `SessionContext` alias `LoadedSession` removed

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/) for the current API.

### RPC Migration

**Session commands:**

- `reset` command → `new_session` command with optional `parentSession` field

**Branching commands:**

- `branch` command: `entryIndex` → `entryId`
- `get_branch_messages` response: `entryIndex` → `entryId`

**Type changes:**

- Messages are now `AgentMessage` (was `AppMessage`)
- `prompt` command: `attachments` field replaced with `images` field using `ImageContent` format

**Compaction events:**

- `auto_compaction_start` now includes `reason` field (`"threshold"` or `"overflow"`)
- `auto_compaction_end` now includes `willRetry` field
- `compact` response includes full `CompactionResult` (`summary`, `firstKeptEntryId`, `tokensBefore`, `details`)

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the current protocol.

### Structured Compaction

Compaction and branch summarization now use a structured output format:

- Clear sections: Goal, Progress, Key Information, File Operations
- File tracking: `readFiles` and `modifiedFiles` arrays in `details`, accumulated across compactions
- Conversations are serialized to text before summarization to prevent the model from "continuing" them

The `before_compact` and `before_tree` hook events allow custom compaction implementations. See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md).

### Interactive Mode

**`/tree` command:**

- Navigate the full session tree in-place
- Search by typing, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press `l` to label entries as bookmarks
- Selecting a branch switches context and optionally injects a summary of the abandoned branch

**Entry labels:**

- Bookmark any entry via `/tree` → select → `l`
- Labels appear in tree view and persist as `LabelEntry`

**Theme changes (breaking for custom themes):**

Custom themes must add these new color tokens or they will fail to load:

- `selectedBg`: background for selected/highlighted items in tree selector and other components
- `customMessageBg`: background for hook-injected messages (`CustomMessageEntry`)
- `customMessageText`: text color for hook messages
- `customMessageLabel`: label color for hook messages (the `[customType]` prefix)

Total color count increased from 46 to 50. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md) for the full color list and copy values from the built-in dark/light themes.

**Settings:**

- `enabledModels`: allowlist models in `settings.json` (same format as `--models` CLI)

### Added

- `ctx.ui.setStatus(key, text)` for hooks to display persistent status text in the footer ([#385](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/385) by [@prateekmedia](https://github.com/prateekmedia))
- `ctx.ui.theme` getter for styling status text and other output with theme colors
- `/share` command to upload session as a secret GitHub gist and get a shareable URL via pi.dev ([#380](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/380))
- HTML export now includes a tree visualization sidebar for navigating session branches ([#375](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/375))
- HTML export supports keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+T to toggle thinking blocks, Ctrl+O to toggle tool outputs
- HTML export supports theme-configurable background colors via optional `export` section in theme JSON ([#387](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/387) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- HTML export syntax highlighting now uses theme colors and matches TUI rendering
- **Snake game example hook**: Demonstrates `ui.custom()`, `registerCommand()`, and session persistence. See [examples/hooks/snake.ts](examples/hooks/snake.ts).
- **`thinkingText` theme token**: Configurable color for thinking block text. ([#366](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/366) by [@paulbettner](https://github.com/paulbettner))

### Changed

- **Entry IDs**: Session entries now use short 8-character hex IDs instead of full UUIDs
- **API key priority**: `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` now takes precedence over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- HTML export template split into separate files (template.html, template.css, template.js) for easier maintenance

### Fixed

- HTML export now properly sanitizes user messages containing HTML tags like `<style>` that could break DOM rendering
- Crash when displaying bash output containing Unicode format characters like U+0600-U+0604 ([#372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/372) by [@HACKE-RC](https://github.com/HACKE-RC))
- **Footer shows full session stats**: Token usage and cost now include all messages, not just those after compaction. ([#322](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/322))
- **Status messages spam chat log**: Rapidly changing settings (e.g., thinking level via Shift+Tab) would add multiple status lines. Sequential status updates now coalesce into a single line. ([#365](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/365) by [@paulbettner](https://github.com/paulbettner))
- **Toggling thinking blocks during streaming shows nothing**: Pressing Ctrl+T while streaming would hide the current message until streaming completed.
- **Resuming session resets thinking level to off**: Initial model and thinking level were not saved to session file, causing `--resume`/`--continue` to default to `off`. ([#342](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/342) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- **Hook `tool_result` event ignores errors from custom tools**: The `tool_result` hook event was never emitted when tools threw errors, and always had `isError: false` for successful executions. Now emits the event with correct `isError` value in both success and error cases. ([#374](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/374) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- **Edit tool fails on Windows due to CRLF line endings**: Files with CRLF line endings now match correctly when LLMs send LF-only text. Line endings are normalized before matching and restored to original style on write. ([#355](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/355) by [@Pratham-Dubey](https://github.com/Pratham-Dubey))
- **Edit tool fails on files with UTF-8 BOM**: Files with UTF-8 BOM marker could cause "text not found" errors since the LLM doesn't include the invisible BOM character. BOM is now stripped before matching and restored on write. ([#394](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/394) by [@prathamdby](https://github.com/prathamdby))
- **Use bash instead of sh on Unix**: Fixed shell commands using `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin/bash` on Unix systems. ([#328](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/328) by [@dnouri](https://github.com/dnouri))
- **OAuth login URL clickable**: Made OAuth login URLs clickable in terminal. ([#349](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/349) by [@Cursivez](https://github.com/Cursivez))
- **Improved error messages**: Better error messages when `apiKey` or `model` are missing. ([#346](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/346) by [@ronyrus](https://github.com/ronyrus))
- **Session file validation**: `findMostRecentSession()` now validates session headers before returning, preventing non-session JSONL files from being loaded
- **Compaction error handling**: `generateSummary()` and `generateTurnPrefixSummary()` now throw on LLM errors instead of returning empty strings
- **Compaction with branched sessions**: Fixed compaction incorrectly including entries from abandoned branches, causing token overflow errors. Compaction now uses `sessionManager.getPath()` to work only on the current branch path, eliminating 80+ lines of duplicate entry collection logic between `prepareCompaction()` and `compact()`
- **enabledModels glob patterns**: `--models` and `enabledModels` now support glob patterns like `github-copilot/*` or `*sonnet*`. Previously, patterns were only matched literally or via substring search. ([#337](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/337))

## [0.30.2] - 2025-12-26

### Changed

- **Consolidated migrations**: Moved auth migration from `AuthStorage.migrateLegacy()` to new `migrations.ts` module.

## [0.30.1] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- **Sessions saved to wrong directory**: In v0.30.0, sessions were being saved to `~/.pi/agent/` instead of `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`, breaking `--resume` and `/resume`. Misplaced sessions are automatically migrated on startup. ([#320](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/320) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- **Custom system prompts missing context**: When using a custom system prompt string, project context files (AGENTS.md), skills, date/time, and working directory were not appended. ([#321](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/321))

## [0.30.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **SessionManager API**: The second parameter of `create()`, `continueRecent()`, and `list()` changed from `agentDir` to `sessionDir`. When provided, it specifies the session directory directly (no cwd encoding). When omitted, uses default (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`). `open()` no longer takes `agentDir`. ([#313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/313))

### Added

- **`--session-dir` flag**: Use a custom directory for sessions instead of the default `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`. Works with `-c` (continue) and `-r` (resume) flags. ([#313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/313) by [@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))
- **Reverse model cycling and model selector**: Shift+Ctrl+P cycles models backward, Ctrl+L opens model selector (retaining text in editor). ([#315](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/315) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.29.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Automatic custom system prompt loading**: Pi now auto-loads `SYSTEM.md` files to replace the default system prompt. Project-local `.pi/SYSTEM.md` takes precedence over global `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md`. CLI `--system-prompt` flag overrides both. ([#309](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/309))
- **Unified `/settings` command**: New settings menu consolidating thinking level, theme, queue mode, auto-compact, show images, hide thinking, and collapse changelog. Replaces individual `/thinking`, `/queue`, `/theme`, `/autocompact`, and `/show-images` commands. ([#310](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/310))

### Fixed

- **Custom tools/hooks with typebox subpath imports**: Fixed jiti alias for `@sinclair/typebox` to point to package root instead of entry file, allowing imports like `@sinclair/typebox/compiler` to resolve correctly. ([#311](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/311) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **Renamed `/clear` to `/new`**: The command to start a fresh session is now `/new`. Hook event reasons `before_clear`/`clear` are now `before_new`/`new`. Merry Christmas [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)! ([#305](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/305))

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) after a word character, a space is automatically prepended. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation in input fields**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
- **Full Unicode input**: Input fields now accept Unicode characters beyond ASCII. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.28.0] - 2025-12-25

### Changed

- **Credential storage refactored**: API keys and OAuth tokens are now stored in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` instead of `oauth.json` and `settings.json`. Existing credentials are automatically migrated on first run. ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296))

- **SDK API changes** ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296)):

  - Added `AuthStorage` class for credential management (API keys and OAuth tokens)
  - Added `ModelRegistry` class for model discovery and API key resolution
  - Added `discoverAuthStorage()` and `discoverModels()` discovery functions
  - `createAgentSession()` now accepts `authStorage` and `modelRegistry` options
  - Removed `configureOAuthStorage()`, `defaultGetApiKey()`, `findModel()`, `discoverAvailableModels()`
  - Removed `getApiKey` callback option (use `AuthStorage.setRuntimeApiKey()` for runtime overrides)
  - Use `getModel()` from `@mariozechner/pi-ai` for built-in models, `modelRegistry.find()` for custom models + built-in models
  - See updated [SDK documentation](docs/sdk.md) and [README](README.md)

- **Settings changes**: Removed `apiKeys` from `settings.json`. Use `auth.json` instead. ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296))

### Fixed

- **Duplicate skill warnings for symlinks**: Skills loaded via symlinks pointing to the same file are now silently deduplicated instead of showing name collision warnings. ([#304](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/304) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.27.9] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Model selector and --list-models with settings.json API keys**: Models with API keys configured in settings.json (but not in environment variables) now properly appear in the /model selector and `--list-models` output. ([#295](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/295))

## [0.27.8] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **API key priority**: OAuth tokens now take priority over settings.json API keys. Previously, an API key in settings.json would trump OAuth, causing users logged in with a plan (unlimited tokens) to be billed via PAYG instead.

## [0.27.7] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Thinking tag leakage**: Fixed Claude mimicking literal `</thinking>` tags in responses. Unsigned thinking blocks (from aborted streams) are now converted to plain text without `<thinking>` tags. The TUI still displays them as thinking blocks. ([#302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/302) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.27.6] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **Compaction hook improvements**: The `before_compact` session event now includes:

  - `previousSummary`: Summary from the last compaction (if any), so hooks can preserve accumulated context
  - `messagesToKeep`: Messages that will be kept after the summary (recent turns), in addition to `messagesToSummarize`
  - `resolveApiKey`: Function to resolve API keys for any model (checks settings, OAuth, env vars)
  - Removed `apiKey` string in favor of `resolveApiKey` for more flexibility

- **SessionManager API cleanup**:
  - Renamed `loadSessionFromEntries()` to `buildSessionContext()` (builds LLM context from entries, handling compaction)
  - Renamed `loadEntries()` to `getEntries()` (returns defensive copy of all session entries)
  - Added `buildSessionContext()` method to SessionManager

## [0.27.5] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **HTML export syntax highlighting**: Code blocks in markdown and tool outputs (read, write) now have syntax highlighting using highlight.js with theme-aware colors matching the TUI.
- **HTML export improvements**: Render markdown server-side using marked (tables, headings, code blocks, etc.), honor user's chosen theme (light/dark), add image rendering for user messages, and style code blocks with TUI-like language markers. ([@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))

### Fixed

- **Ghostty inline images in tmux**: Fixed terminal detection for Ghostty when running inside tmux by checking `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` env var. ([#299](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/299) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.27.4] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Symlinked skill directories**: Skills in symlinked directories (e.g., `~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skills -> /path/to/skills`) are now correctly discovered and loaded.

## [0.27.3] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **API keys in settings.json**: Store API keys in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` under the `apiKeys` field (e.g., `{ "apiKeys": { "anthropic": "sk-..." } }`). Settings keys take priority over environment variables. ([#295](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/295))

### Fixed

- **Allow startup without API keys**: Interactive mode no longer throws when no API keys are configured. Users can now start the agent and use `/login` to authenticate. ([#288](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/288))
- **`--system-prompt` file path support**: The `--system-prompt` argument now correctly resolves file paths (like `--append-system-prompt` already did). ([#287](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/287) by [@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))

## [0.27.2] - 2025-12-23

### Added

- **Skip conversation restore on branch**: Hooks can return `{ skipConversationRestore: true }` from `before_branch` to create the branched session file without restoring conversation messages. Useful for checkpoint hooks that restore files separately. ([#286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/286) by [@nicobarray](https://github.com/nicobarray))

## [0.27.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **Skill discovery performance**: Skip `node_modules` directories when recursively scanning for skills. Fixes ~60ms startup delay when skill directories contain npm dependencies.

### Added

- **Startup timing instrumentation**: Set `PI_TIMING=1` to see startup performance breakdown (interactive mode only).

## [0.27.0] - 2025-12-22

### Breaking

- **Session hooks API redesign**: Merged `branch` event into `session` event. `BranchEvent`, `BranchEventResult` types and `pi.on("branch", ...)` removed. Use `pi.on("session", ...)` with `reason: "before_branch" | "branch"` instead. `AgentSession.branch()` returns `{ cancelled }` instead of `{ skipped }`. `AgentSession.reset()` and `switchSession()` now return `boolean` (false if cancelled by hook). RPC commands `reset`, `switch_session`, and `branch` now include `cancelled` in response data. ([#278](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/278))

### Added

- **Session lifecycle hooks**: Added `before_*` variants (`before_switch`, `before_clear`, `before_branch`) that fire before actions and can be cancelled with `{ cancel: true }`. Added `shutdown` reason for graceful exit handling. ([#278](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/278))

### Fixed

- **File tab completion display**: File paths no longer get cut off early. Folders now show trailing `/` and removed redundant "directory"/"file" labels to maximize horizontal space. ([#280](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/280))

- **Bash tool visual line truncation**: Fixed bash tool output in collapsed mode to use visual line counting (accounting for line wrapping) instead of logical line counting. Now consistent with bash-execution.ts behavior. Extracted shared `truncateToVisualLines` utility. ([#275](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/275))

## [0.26.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **SDK tools respect cwd**: Core tools (bash, read, edit, write, grep, find, ls) now properly use the `cwd` option from `createAgentSession()`. Added tool factory functions (`createBashTool`, `createReadTool`, etc.) for SDK users who specify custom `cwd` with explicit tools. ([#279](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/279))

## [0.26.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added

- **SDK for programmatic usage**: New `createAgentSession()` factory with full control over model, tools, hooks, skills, session persistence, and settings. Philosophy: "omit to discover, provide to override". Includes 12 examples and comprehensive documentation. ([#272](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/272))

- **Project-specific settings**: Settings now load from both `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (global) and `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json` (project). Project settings override global with deep merge for nested objects. Project settings are read-only (for version control). ([#276](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/276))

- **SettingsManager static factories**: `SettingsManager.create(cwd?, agentDir?)` for file-based settings, `SettingsManager.inMemory(settings?)` for testing. Added `applyOverrides()` for programmatic overrides.

- **SessionManager static factories**: `SessionManager.create()`, `SessionManager.open()`, `SessionManager.continueRecent()`, `SessionManager.inMemory()`, `SessionManager.list()` for flexible session management.

## [0.25.4] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **Syntax highlighting stderr spam**: Fixed cli-highlight logging errors to stderr when markdown contains malformed code fences (e.g., missing newlines around closing backticks). Now validates language identifiers before highlighting and falls back silently to plain text. ([#274](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/274))

## [0.25.3] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **Gemini 3 preview models**: Added `gemini-3-pro-preview` and `gemini-3-flash-preview` to the google-gemini-cli provider. ([#264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/264) by [@LukeFost](https://github.com/LukeFost))

- **External editor support**: Press `Ctrl+G` to edit your message in an external editor. Uses `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` environment variable. On successful save, the message is replaced; on cancel, the original is kept. ([#266](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/266) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Process suspension**: Press `Ctrl+Z` to suspend pi and return to the shell. Resume with `fg` as usual. ([#267](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/267) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Configurable skills directories**: Added granular control over skill sources with `enableCodexUser`, `enableClaudeUser`, `enableClaudeProject`, `enablePiUser`, `enablePiProject` toggles, plus `customDirectories` and `ignoredSkills` settings. ([#269](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/269) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Skills CLI filtering**: Added `--skills <patterns>` flag for filtering skills with glob patterns. Also added `includeSkills` setting and glob pattern support for `ignoredSkills`. ([#268](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/268))

## [0.25.2] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **Image shifting in tool output**: Fixed an issue where images in tool output would shift down (due to accumulating spacers) each time the tool output was expanded or collapsed via Ctrl+O.

## [0.25.1] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **Gemini image reading broken**: Fixed the `read` tool returning images causing flaky/broken responses with Gemini models. Images in tool results are now properly formatted per the Gemini API spec.

- **Tab completion for absolute paths**: Fixed tab completion producing `//tmp` instead of `/tmp/`. Also fixed symlinks to directories (like `/tmp`) not getting a trailing slash, which prevented continuing to tab through subdirectories.

## [0.25.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added

- **Interruptible tool execution**: Queuing a message while tools are executing now interrupts the current tool batch. Remaining tools are skipped with an error result, and your queued message is processed immediately. Useful for redirecting the agent mid-task. ([#259](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/259) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))

- **Google Gemini CLI OAuth provider**: Access Gemini 2.0/2.5 models for free via Google Cloud Code Assist. Login with `/login` and select "Google Gemini CLI". Uses your Google account with rate limits.

- **Google Antigravity OAuth provider**: Access Gemini 3, Claude (sonnet/opus thinking models), and GPT-OSS models for free via Google's Antigravity sandbox. Login with `/login` and select "Antigravity". Uses your Google account with rate limits.

### Changed

- **Model selector respects --models scope**: The `/model` command now only shows models specified via `--models` flag when that flag is used, instead of showing all available models. This prevents accidentally selecting models from unintended providers. ([#255](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/255))

### Fixed

- **Connection errors not retried**: Added "connection error" to the list of retryable errors so Anthropic connection drops trigger auto-retry instead of silently failing. ([#252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/252))

- **Thinking level not clamped on model switch**: Fixed TUI showing xhigh thinking level after switching to a model that doesn't support it. Thinking level is now automatically clamped to model capabilities. ([#253](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/253))

- **Cross-model thinking handoff**: Fixed error when switching between models with different thinking signature formats (e.g., GPT-OSS to Claude thinking models via Antigravity). Thinking blocks without signatures are now converted to text with `<thinking>` delimiters.

## [0.24.5] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **Input buffering in iTerm2**: Fixed Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and other keys requiring multiple presses in iTerm2. The cell size query response parser was incorrectly holding back keyboard input.

## [0.24.4] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **Arrow keys and Enter in selector components**: Fixed arrow keys and Enter not working in model selector, session selector, OAuth selector, and other selector components when Caps Lock or Num Lock is enabled. ([#243](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/243))

## [0.24.3] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

- **Footer overflow on narrow terminals**: Fixed footer path display exceeding terminal width when resizing to very narrow widths, causing rendering crashes. /arminsayshi

## [0.24.2] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **More Kitty keyboard protocol fixes**: Fixed Backspace, Enter, Home, End, and Delete keys not working with Caps Lock enabled. The initial fix in 0.24.1 missed several key handlers that were still using raw byte detection. Now all key handlers use the helper functions that properly mask out lock key bits. ([#243](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/243))

## [0.24.1] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **OAuth and model config exports**: Scripts using `AgentSession` directly can now import `getAvailableModels`, `getApiKeyForModel`, `findModel`, `login`, `logout`, and `getOAuthProviders` from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to reuse OAuth token storage and model resolution. ([#245](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/245))

- **xhigh thinking level for gpt-5.2 models**: The thinking level selector and shift+tab cycling now show xhigh option for gpt-5.2 and gpt-5.2-codex models (in addition to gpt-5.1-codex-max). ([#236](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/236) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

### Fixed

- **Hooks wrap custom tools**: Custom tools are now executed through the hook wrapper, so `tool_call`/`tool_result` hooks can observe, block, and modify custom tool executions (consistent with hook type docs). ([#248](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/248) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Hook onUpdate callback forwarding**: The `onUpdate` callback is now correctly forwarded through the hook wrapper, fixing custom tool progress updates. ([#238](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/238) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Terminal cleanup on Ctrl+C in session selector**: Fixed terminal not being properly restored when pressing Ctrl+C in the session selector. ([#247](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/247) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **OpenRouter models with colons in IDs**: Fixed parsing of OpenRouter model IDs that contain colons (e.g., `openrouter:meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free`). ([#242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/242) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Global AGENTS.md loaded twice**: Fixed global AGENTS.md being loaded twice when present in both `~/.pi/agent/` and the current directory. ([#239](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/239) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Kitty keyboard protocol on Linux**: Fixed keyboard input not working in Ghostty on Linux when Num Lock is enabled. The Kitty protocol includes Caps Lock and Num Lock state in modifier values, which broke key detection. Now correctly masks out lock key bits when matching keyboard shortcuts. ([#243](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/243))

- **Emoji deletion and cursor movement**: Backspace, Delete, and arrow keys now correctly handle multi-codepoint characters like emojis. Previously, deleting an emoji would leave partial bytes, corrupting the editor state. ([#240](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/240))

## [0.24.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Subagent orchestration example**: Added comprehensive custom tool example for spawning and orchestrating sub-agents with isolated context windows. Includes scout/planner/reviewer/worker agents and workflow commands for multi-agent pipelines. ([#215](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/215) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **`getMarkdownTheme()` export**: Custom tools can now import `getMarkdownTheme()` from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to use the same markdown styling as the main UI.

- **`pi.exec()` signal and timeout support**: Custom tools and hooks can now pass `{ signal, timeout }` options to `pi.exec()` for cancellation and timeout handling. The result includes a `killed` flag when the process was terminated.

- **Kitty keyboard protocol support**: Shift+Enter, Alt+Enter, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+D, and all Ctrl+key combinations now work in Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, and other modern terminals. ([#225](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/225) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

- **Dynamic API key refresh**: OAuth tokens (GitHub Copilot, Anthropic OAuth) are now refreshed before each LLM call, preventing failures in long-running agent loops where tokens expire mid-session. ([#223](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/223) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

- **`/hotkeys` command**: Shows all keyboard shortcuts in a formatted table.

- **Markdown table borders**: Tables now render with proper top and bottom borders.

### Changed

- **Subagent example improvements**: Parallel mode now streams updates from all tasks. Chain mode shows all completed steps during streaming. Expanded view uses proper markdown rendering with syntax highlighting. Usage footer shows turn count.

- **Skills standard compliance**: Skills now adhere to the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). Validates name (must match parent directory, lowercase, max 64 chars), description (required, max 1024 chars), and frontmatter fields. Warns on violations but remains lenient. Prompt format changed to XML structure. Removed `{baseDir}` placeholder in favor of relative paths. ([#231](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/231))

### Fixed

- **JSON mode stdout flush**: Fixed race condition where `pi --mode json` could exit before all output was written to stdout, causing consumers to miss final events.

- **Symlinked tools, hooks, and slash commands**: Discovery now correctly follows symlinks when scanning for custom tools, hooks, and slash commands. ([#219](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/219), [#232](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/232) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

### Breaking Changes

- **Custom tools now require `index.ts` entry point**: Auto-discovered custom tools must be in a subdirectory with an `index.ts` file. The old pattern `~/.pi/agent/tools/mytool.ts` must become `~/.pi/agent/tools/mytool/index.ts`. This allows multi-file tools to import helper modules. Explicit paths via `--tool` or `settings.json` still work with any `.ts` file.

- **Hook `tool_result` event restructured**: The `ToolResultEvent` now exposes full tool result data instead of just text. ([#233](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/233))
  - Removed: `result: string` field
  - Added: `content: (TextContent | ImageContent)[]` - full content array
  - Added: `details: unknown` - tool-specific details (typed per tool via discriminated union on `toolName`)
  - `ToolResultEventResult.result` renamed to `ToolResultEventResult.text` (removed), use `content` instead
  - Hook handlers returning `{ result: "..." }` must change to `{ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] }`
  - Built-in tool details types exported: `BashToolDetails`, `ReadToolDetails`, `GrepToolDetails`, `FindToolDetails`, `LsToolDetails`, `TruncationResult`
  - Type guards exported for narrowing: `isBashToolResult`, `isReadToolResult`, `isEditToolResult`, `isWriteToolResult`, `isGrepToolResult`, `isFindToolResult`, `isLsToolResult`

## [0.23.4] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **Syntax highlighting**: Added syntax highlighting for markdown code blocks, read tool output, and write tool content. Uses cli-highlight with theme-aware color mapping and VS Code-style syntax colors. ([#214](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/214) by [@svkozak](https://github.com/svkozak))

- **Intra-line diff highlighting**: Edit tool now shows word-level changes with inverse highlighting when a single line is modified. Multi-line changes show all removed lines first, then all added lines.

### Fixed

- **Gemini tool result format**: Fixed tool result format for Gemini 3 Flash Preview which strictly requires `{ output: value }` for success and `{ error: value }` for errors. Previous format using `{ result, isError }` was rejected by newer Gemini models. ([#213](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/213), [#220](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/220))

- **Google baseUrl configuration**: Google provider now respects `baseUrl` configuration for custom endpoints or API proxies. ([#216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/216), [#221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/221) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

- **Google provider FinishReason**: Added handling for new `IMAGE_RECITATION` and `IMAGE_OTHER` finish reasons. Upgraded @google/genai to 1.34.0.

## [0.23.3] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Check for compaction before submitting user prompt, not just after agent turn ends. This catches cases where user aborts mid-response and context is already near the limit.

### Changed

- Improved system prompt documentation section with clearer pointers to specific doc files for custom models, themes, skills, hooks, custom tools, and RPC.

- Cleaned up documentation:

  - `theme.md`: Added missing color tokens (`thinkingXhigh`, `bashMode`)
  - `skills.md`: Rewrote with better framing and examples
  - `hooks.md`: Fixed timeout/error handling docs, added import aliases section
  - `custom-tools.md`: Added intro with use cases and comparison table
  - `rpc.md`: Added missing `hook_error` event documentation
  - `README.md`: Complete settings table, condensed philosophy section, standardized OAuth docs

- Hooks loader now supports same import aliases as custom tools (`@sinclair/typebox`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`).

### Breaking Changes

- **Hooks**: `turn_end` event's `toolResults` type changed from `AppMessage[]` to `ToolResultMessage[]`. If you have hooks that handle `turn_end` events and explicitly type the results, update your type annotations.

## [0.23.2] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude models via GitHub Copilot re-answering all previous prompts in multi-turn conversations. The issue was that assistant message content was sent as an array instead of a string, which Copilot's Claude adapter misinterpreted. Also added missing `Openai-Intent: conversation-edits` header and fixed `X-Initiator` logic to check for any assistant/tool message in history. ([#209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/209))

- Detect image MIME type via file magic (read tool and `@file` attachments), not filename extension.

- Fixed markdown tables overflowing terminal width. Tables now wrap cell contents to fit available width instead of breaking borders mid-row. ([#206](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/206) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.23.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI performance regression caused by Box component lacking render caching. Built-in tools now use Text directly (like v0.22.5), and Box has proper caching for custom tool rendering.

- Fixed custom tools failing to load from `~/.pi/agent/tools/` when pi is installed globally. Module imports (`@sinclair/typebox`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`) are now resolved via aliases.

## [0.23.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- **Custom tools**: Extend pi with custom tools written in TypeScript. Tools can provide custom TUI rendering, interact with users via `pi.ui` (select, confirm, input, notify), and maintain state across sessions via `onSession` callback. See [docs/custom-tools.md](docs/custom-tools.md) and [examples/custom-tools/](examples/custom-tools/). ([#190](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/190))

- **Hook and tool examples**: Added `examples/hooks/` and `examples/custom-tools/` with working examples. Examples are now bundled in npm and binary releases.

### Breaking Changes

- **Hooks**: Replaced `session_start` and `session_switch` events with unified `session` event. Use `event.reason` (`"start" | "switch" | "clear"`) to distinguish. Event now includes `entries` array for state reconstruction.

## [0.22.5] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed `--session` flag not saving sessions in print mode (`-p`). The session manager was never receiving events because no subscriber was attached.

## [0.22.4] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- `--list-models [search]` CLI flag to list available models with optional fuzzy search. Shows provider, model ID, context window, max output, thinking support, and image support. Only lists models with configured API keys. ([#203](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/203))

### Fixed

- Fixed tool execution showing green (success) background while still running. Now correctly shows gray (pending) background until the tool completes.

## [0.22.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Streaming bash output**: Bash tool now streams output in real-time during execution. The TUI displays live progress with the last 5 lines visible (expandable with ctrl+o). ([#44](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/44))

### Changed

- **Tool output display**: When collapsed, tool output now shows the last N lines instead of the first N lines, making streaming output more useful.

- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-ai` with X-Initiator header support for GitHub Copilot, ensuring agent calls are not deducted from quota. ([#200](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/200) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- Fixed editor text being cleared during compaction. Text typed while compaction is running is now preserved. ([#179](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/179))
- Improved RGB to 256-color mapping for terminals without truecolor support. Now correctly uses grayscale ramp for neutral colors and preserves semantic tints (green for success, red for error, blue for pending) instead of mapping everything to wrong cube colors.
- `/think off` now actually disables thinking for all providers. Previously, providers like Gemini with "dynamic thinking" enabled by default would still use thinking even when turned off. ([#180](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/180) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.22.2] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-ai` with interleaved thinking enabled by default for Anthropic Claude 4 models.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-12-15

_Dedicated to Peter's shoulder ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))_

### Changed

- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-ai` with interleaved thinking support for Anthropic models.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot support**: Use GitHub Copilot models via OAuth login (`/login` -> "GitHub Copilot"). Supports both github.com and GitHub Enterprise. Models are sourced from models.dev and include Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and more. All models are automatically enabled after login. ([#191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/191) by [@cau1k](https://github.com/cau1k))

### Fixed

- Model selector fuzzy search now matches against provider name (not just model ID) and supports space-separated tokens where all tokens must match

## [0.21.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Inline image rendering**: Terminals supporting Kitty graphics protocol (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm) or iTerm2 inline images now render images inline in tool output. Aspect ratio is preserved by querying terminal cell dimensions on startup. Toggle with `/show-images` command or `terminal.showImages` setting. Falls back to text placeholder on unsupported terminals or when disabled. ([#177](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/177) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Gemini 3 Pro thinking levels**: Thinking level selector now works with Gemini 3 Pro models. Minimal/low map to Google's LOW, medium/high map to Google's HIGH. ([#176](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/176) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

### Fixed

- Fixed read tool failing on macOS screenshot filenames due to Unicode Narrow No-Break Space (U+202F) in timestamp. Added fallback to try macOS variant paths and consolidated duplicate expandPath functions into shared path-utils.ts. ([#181](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/181) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- Fixed double blank lines rendering after markdown code blocks ([#173](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/173) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.20.1] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Exported skills API**: `loadSkillsFromDir`, `formatSkillsForPrompt`, and related types are now exported for use by other packages (e.g., mom).

## [0.20.0] - 2025-12-13

### Breaking Changes

- **Pi skills now use `SKILL.md` convention**: Pi skills must now be named `SKILL.md` inside a directory, matching Codex CLI format. Previously any `*.md` file was treated as a skill. Migrate by renaming `~/.pi/agent/skills/foo.md` to `~/.pi/agent/skills/foo/SKILL.md`.

### Added

- Display loaded skills on startup in interactive mode

## [0.19.1] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- Documentation: Added skills system documentation to README (setup, usage, CLI flags, settings)

## [0.19.0] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- **Skills system**: Auto-discover and load instruction files on-demand. Supports Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`), Codex CLI (`~/.codex/skills/`), and Pi-native formats (`~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`). Skills are listed in system prompt with descriptions, agent loads them via read tool when needed. Supports `{baseDir}` placeholder. Disable with `--no-skills` or `skills.enabled: false` in settings. ([#169](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/169))

- **Version flag**: Added `--version` / `-v` flag to display the current version and exit. ([#170](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/170))

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-11

### Added

- **Auto-retry on transient errors**: Automatically retries requests when providers return overloaded, rate limit, or server errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504). Uses exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s). Shows retry status in TUI with option to cancel via Escape. Configurable in `settings.json` via `retry.enabled`, `retry.maxRetries`, `retry.baseDelayMs`. RPC mode emits `auto_retry_start` and `auto_retry_end` events. ([#157](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/157))

- **HTML export line numbers**: Read tool calls in HTML exports now display line number ranges (e.g., `file.txt:10-20`) when offset/limit parameters are used, matching the TUI display format. Line numbers appear in yellow color for better visibility. ([#166](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/166))

### Fixed

- **Branch selector now works with single message**: Previously the branch selector would not open when there was only one user message. Now it correctly allows branching from any message, including the first one. This is needed for checkpoint hooks to restore state from before the first message. ([#163](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/163))

- **In-memory branching for `--no-session` mode**: Branching now works correctly in `--no-session` mode without creating any session files. The conversation is truncated in memory.

- **Git branch indicator now works in subdirectories**: The footer's git branch detection now walks up the directory hierarchy to find the git root, so it works when running pi from a subdirectory of a repository. ([#156](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/156))

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models. Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed print mode (`-p`) not exiting after output when custom themes are present (theme watcher now properly stops in print mode) ([#161](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/161))

## [0.18.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Hooks system**: TypeScript modules that extend agent behavior by subscribing to lifecycle events. Hooks can intercept tool calls, prompt for confirmation, modify results, and inject messages from external sources. Auto-discovered from `~/.pi/agent/hooks/*.ts` and `.pi/hooks/*.ts`. Thanks to [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon) for the collaboration on the design and implementation. ([#145](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/145), supersedes [#158](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/158))

- **`pi.send()` API**: Hooks can inject messages into the agent session from external sources (file watchers, webhooks, CI systems). If streaming, messages are queued; otherwise a new agent loop starts immediately.

- **`--hook <path>` CLI flag**: Load hook files directly for testing without modifying settings.

- **Hook events**: `session_start`, `session_switch`, `agent_start`, `agent_end`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`, `tool_call` (can block), `tool_result` (can modify), `branch`.

- **Hook UI primitives**: `ctx.ui.select()`, `ctx.ui.confirm()`, `ctx.ui.input()`, `ctx.ui.notify()` for interactive prompts from hooks.

- **Hooks documentation**: Full API reference at `docs/hooks.md`, shipped with npm package.

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- **Simplified compaction flow**: Removed proactive compaction (aborting mid-turn when threshold approached). Compaction now triggers in two cases only: (1) overflow error from LLM, which compacts and auto-retries, or (2) threshold crossed after a successful turn, which compacts without retry.

- **Compaction retry uses `Agent.continue()`**: Auto-retry after overflow now uses the new `continue()` API instead of re-sending the user message, preserving exact context state.

- **Merged turn prefix summary**: When a turn is split during compaction, the turn prefix summary is now merged into the main history summary instead of being stored separately.

### Added

- **`isCompacting` property on AgentSession**: Check if auto-compaction is currently running.

- **Session compaction indicator**: When resuming a compacted session, displays "Session compacted N times" status message.

### Fixed

- **Block input during compaction**: User input is now blocked while auto-compaction is running to prevent race conditions.

- **Skip error messages in usage calculation**: Context size estimation now skips both aborted and error messages, as neither have valid usage data.

## [0.16.0] - 2025-12-09

### Breaking Changes

- **New RPC protocol**: The RPC mode (`--mode rpc`) has been completely redesigned with a new JSON protocol. The old protocol is no longer supported. See [`docs/rpc.md`](docs/rpc.md) for the new protocol documentation and [`test/rpc-example.ts`](test/rpc-example.ts) for a working example. Includes `RpcClient` TypeScript class for easy integration. ([#91](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/91))

### Changed

- **README restructured**: Reorganized documentation from 30+ flat sections into 10 logical groups. Converted verbose subsections to scannable tables. Consolidated philosophy sections. Reduced size by ~60% while preserving all information.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- **Major code refactoring**: Restructured codebase for better maintainability and separation of concerns. Moved files into organized directories (`core/`, `modes/`, `utils/`, `cli/`). Extracted `AgentSession` class as central session management abstraction. Split `main.ts` and `tui-renderer.ts` into focused modules. See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for the new code map. ([#153](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/153))

## [0.14.2] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- `/debug` command now includes agent messages as JSONL in the output

### Fixed

- Fix crash when bash command outputs binary data (e.g., `curl` downloading a video file)

## [0.14.1] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- Fix build errors with tsgo 7.0.0-dev.20251208.1 by properly importing `ReasoningEffort` type

## [0.14.0] - 2025-12-08

### Breaking Changes

- **Custom themes require new color tokens**: Themes must now include `thinkingXhigh` and `bashMode` color tokens. The theme loader provides helpful error messages listing missing tokens. See built-in themes (dark.json, light.json) for reference values.

### Added

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides in models.json**: Custom models using `openai-completions` API can now specify a `compat` object to override provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh thinking level**: Added `xhigh` thinking level for OpenAI codex-max models. Cycle through thinking levels with Shift+Tab; `xhigh` appears only when using a codex-max model. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

- **Collapse changelog setting**: Add `"collapseChangelog": true` to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` to show a condensed "Updated to vX.Y.Z" message instead of the full changelog after updates. Use `/changelog` to view the full changelog. ([#148](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/148))

- **Bash mode**: Execute shell commands directly from the editor by prefixing with `!` (e.g., `!ls -la`). Output streams in real-time, is added to the LLM context, and persists in session history. Supports multiline commands, cancellation (Escape), truncation for large outputs, and preview/expand toggle (Ctrl+O). Also available in RPC mode via `{"type":"bash","command":"..."}`. ([#112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/112), original implementation by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.13.2] - 2025-12-07

### Changed

- **Tool output truncation**: All tools now enforce consistent truncation limits with actionable notices for the LLM. ([#134](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/134))
  - **Limits**: 2000 lines OR 50KB (whichever hits first), never partial lines
  - **read**: Shows `[Showing lines X-Y of Z. Use offset=N to continue]`. If first line exceeds 50KB, suggests bash command
  - **bash**: Tail truncation with temp file. Shows `[Showing lines X-Y of Z. Full output: /tmp/...]`
  - **grep**: Pre-truncates match lines to 500 chars. Shows match limit and line truncation notices
  - **find/ls**: Shows result/entry limit notices
  - TUI displays truncation warnings in yellow at bottom of tool output (visible even when collapsed)

## [0.13.1] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- **Flexible Windows shell configuration**: The bash tool now supports multiple shell sources beyond Git Bash. Resolution order: (1) custom `shellPath` in settings.json, (2) Git Bash in standard locations, (3) any bash.exe on PATH. This enables Cygwin, MSYS2, and other bash environments. Configure with `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`: `{"shellPath": "C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash.exe"}`.

### Fixed

- **Windows binary detection**: Fixed Bun compiled binary detection on Windows by checking for URL-encoded `%7EBUN` in addition to `$bunfs` and `~BUN` in `import.meta.url`. This ensures the binary correctly locates supporting files (package.json, themes, etc.) next to the executable.

## [0.12.15] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed

- **Editor crash with emojis/CJK characters**: Fixed crash when pasting or typing text containing wide characters (emojis like ✅, CJK characters) that caused line width to exceed terminal width. The editor now uses grapheme-aware text wrapping with proper visible width calculation.

## [0.12.14] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- **Double-Escape Branch Shortcut**: Press Escape twice with an empty editor to quickly open the `/branch` selector for conversation branching.

## [0.12.13] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **Faster startup**: Version check now runs in parallel with TUI initialization instead of blocking startup for up to 1 second. Update notifications appear in chat when the check completes.

## [0.12.12] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **Footer display**: Token counts now use M suffix for millions (e.g., `10.2M` instead of `10184k`). Context display shortened from `61.3% of 200k` to `61.3%/200k`.

### Fixed

- **Multi-key sequences in inputs**: Inputs like model search now handle multi-key sequences identically to the main prompt editor. ([#122](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/122) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Line wrapping escape codes**: Fixed underline style bleeding into padding when wrapping long URLs. ANSI codes now attach to the correct content, and line-end resets only turn off underline (preserving background colors). ([#109](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/109))

### Added

- **Fuzzy search models and sessions**: Implemented a simple fuzzy search for models and sessions (e.g., `codexmax` now finds `gpt-5.1-codex-max`). ([#122](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/122) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Prompt History Navigation**: Browse previously submitted prompts using Up/Down arrow keys when the editor is empty. Press Up to cycle through older prompts, Down to return to newer ones or clear the editor. Similar to shell history and Claude Code's prompt history feature. History is session-scoped and stores up to 100 entries. ([#121](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/121) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- **`/resume` Command**: Switch to a different session mid-conversation. Opens an interactive selector showing all available sessions. Equivalent to the `--resume` CLI flag but can be used without restarting the agent. ([#117](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/117) by [@hewliyang](https://github.com/hewliyang))

## [0.12.11] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **Compaction UI**: Simplified collapsed compaction indicator to show warning-colored text with token count instead of styled banner. Removed redundant success message after compaction. ([#108](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/108))

### Fixed

- **Print mode error handling**: `-p` flag now outputs error messages and exits with code 1 when requests fail, instead of silently producing no output.
- **Branch selector crash**: Fixed TUI crash when user messages contained Unicode characters (like `✔` or `›`) that caused line width to exceed terminal width. Now uses proper `truncateToWidth` instead of `substring`.
- **Bash output escape sequences**: Fixed incomplete stripping of terminal escape sequences in bash tool output. `stripAnsi` misses some sequences like standalone String Terminator (`ESC \`), which could cause rendering issues when displaying captured TUI output.
- **Footer overflow crash**: Fixed TUI crash when terminal width is too narrow for the footer stats line. The footer now truncates gracefully instead of overflowing.

### Added

- **`authHeader` option in models.json**: Custom providers can set `"authHeader": true` to automatically add `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` header. Useful for providers that require explicit auth headers. ([#81](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/81))
- **`--append-system-prompt` Flag**: Append additional text or file contents to the system prompt. Supports both inline text and file paths. Complements `--system-prompt` for layering custom instructions without replacing the base system prompt. ([#114](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/114) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Thinking Block Toggle**: Added `Ctrl+T` shortcut to toggle visibility of LLM thinking blocks. When toggled off, shows a static "Thinking..." label instead of full content. Useful for reducing visual clutter during long conversations. ([#113](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/113) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

## [0.12.9] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- **`/copy` Command**: Copy the last agent message to clipboard. Works cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux). Useful for extracting text from rendered Markdown output. ([#105](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/105) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.12.8] - 2025-12-04

- Fix: Use CTRL+O consistently for compaction expand shortcut (not CMD+O on Mac)

## [0.12.7] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- **Context Compaction**: Long sessions can now be compacted to reduce context usage while preserving recent conversation history. ([#92](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/92), [docs](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/README.md#context-compaction))
  - `/compact [instructions]`: Manually compact context with optional custom instructions for the summary
  - `/autocompact`: Toggle automatic compaction when context exceeds threshold
  - Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent messages (default 20k tokens) verbatim
  - Auto-compaction triggers when context reaches `contextWindow - reserveTokens` (default 16k reserve)
  - Compacted sessions show a collapsible summary in the TUI (toggle with `o` key)
  - HTML exports include compaction summaries as collapsible sections
  - RPC mode supports `{"type":"compact"}` command and auto-compaction (emits compaction events)
- **Branch Source Tracking**: Branched sessions now store `branchedFrom` in the session header, containing the path to the original session file. Useful for tracing session lineage.

## [0.12.5] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Forking/Rebranding Support**: All branding (app name, config directory, environment variable names) is now configurable via `piConfig` in `package.json`. Forks can change `piConfig.name` and `piConfig.configDir` to rebrand the CLI without code changes. Affects CLI banner, help text, config paths, and error messages. ([#95](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/95))

### Fixed

- **Bun Binary Detection**: Fixed Bun compiled binary failing to start after Bun updated its virtual filesystem path format from `%7EBUN` to `$bunfs`. ([#95](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/95))

## [0.12.4] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **RPC Termination Safeguard**: When running as an RPC worker (stdin pipe detected), the CLI now exits immediately if the parent process terminates unexpectedly. Prevents orphaned RPC workers from persisting indefinitely and consuming system resources.

## [0.12.3] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed

- **Rate limit handling**: Anthropic rate limit errors now trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff (base 10s, max 5 retries). Previously these errors would abort the request immediately.
- **Usage tracking during retries**: Retried requests now correctly accumulate token usage from all attempts, not just the final successful one. Fixes artificially low token counts when requests were retried.

## [0.12.2] - 2025-12-02

### Changed

- Removed support for gpt-4.5-preview and o3 models (not yet available)

## [0.12.1] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **Models**: Added support for OpenAI's new models:
  - `gpt-4.1` (128K context)
  - `gpt-4.1-mini` (128K context)
  - `gpt-4.1-nano` (128K context)
  - `o3` (200K context, reasoning model)
  - `o4-mini` (200K context, reasoning model)

## [0.12.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **`-p, --print` Flag**: Run in non-interactive batch mode. Processes input message or piped stdin without TUI, prints agent response directly to stdout. Ideal for scripting, piping, and CI/CD integration. Exits after first response.
- **`-P, --print-streaming` Flag**: Like `-p`, but streams response tokens as they arrive. Use `--print-streaming --no-markdown` for raw unformatted output.
- **`--print-turn` Flag**: Continue processing tool calls and agent turns until the agent naturally finishes or requires user input. Combine with `-p` for complete multi-turn conversations.
- **`--no-markdown` Flag**: Output raw text without Markdown formatting. Useful when piping output to tools that expect plain text.
- **Streaming Print Mode**: Added internal `printStreaming` option for streaming output in non-TUI mode.
- **RPC Mode `print` Command**: Send `{"type":"print","content":"text"}` to get formatted print output via `print_output` events.
- **Auto-Save in Print Mode**: Print mode conversations are automatically saved to the session directory, allowing later resumption with `--continue`.
- **Thinking level options**: Added `--thinking-off`, `--thinking-minimal`, `--thinking-low`, `--thinking-medium`, `--thinking-high` flags for directly specifying thinking level without the selector UI.

### Changed

- **Simplified RPC Protocol**: Replaced the `prompt` wrapper command with direct message objects. Send `{"role":"user","content":"text"}` instead of `{"type":"prompt","message":"text"}`. Better aligns with message format throughout the codebase.
- **RPC Message Handling**: Agent now processes raw message objects directly, with `timestamp` auto-populated if missing.

## [0.11.9] - 2025-12-02

### Changed

- Change Ctrl+I to Ctrl+P for model cycling shortcut to avoid collision with Tab key in some terminals

## [0.11.8] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Absolute glob patterns (e.g., `/Users/foo/**/*.ts`) are now handled correctly. Previously the leading `/` was being stripped, causing the pattern to be interpreted relative to the current directory.

## [0.11.7] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Fix read path traversal vulnerability. Paths are now validated to prevent reading outside the working directory or its parents. The `read` tool can read from `cwd`, its ancestors (for config files), and all descendants. Symlinks are resolved before validation.

## [0.11.6] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Fix `--system-prompt <path>` allowing the path argument to be captured by the message collection, causing "file not found" errors.

## [0.11.5] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed

- Fixed fatal error "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting '0')" when editing empty files in the `edit` tool.
- Simplified `edit` tool output: Shows only "Edited file.txt" for successful edits instead of verbose search/replace details.
- Fixed fatal error in footer rendering when token counts contain NaN values due to missing usage data.

## [0.11.4] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed

- Fixed chat rendering crash when messages contain preformatted/styled text (e.g., thinking traces with gray italic styling). The markdown renderer now preserves existing ANSI escape codes when they appear before inline elements.

## [0.11.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Fix file drop functionality for absolute paths

## [0.11.2] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI crash when pasting content containing tab characters. Tabs are now converted to 4 spaces before insertion.
- Fixed terminal corruption after exit when shell integration sequences (OSC 133) appeared in bash output. These sequences are now stripped along with other ANSI codes.

## [0.11.1] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- Added `fd` integration for file path autocompletion. Now uses `fd` for faster fuzzy file search

### Fixed

- Fixed keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+W, and word navigation (Option+Arrow) not working in VS Code integrated terminal and some other terminal emulators

## [0.11.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **File-based Slash Commands**: Create custom reusable prompts as `.txt` files in `~/.pi/slash-commands/`. Files become `/filename` commands with first-line descriptions. Supports `{{selection}}` placeholder for referencing selected/attached content.
- **`/branch` Command**: Create conversation branches from any previous user message. Opens a selector to pick a message, then creates a new session file starting from that point. Original message text is placed in the editor for modification.
- **Unified Content References**: Both `@path` in messages and `--file path` CLI arguments now use the same attachment system with consistent MIME type detection.
- **Drag & Drop Files**: Drop files onto the terminal to attach them to your message. Supports multiple files and both text and image content.

### Changed

- **Model Selector with Search**: The `/model` command now opens a searchable list. Type to filter models by name, use arrows to navigate, Enter to select.
- **Improved File Autocomplete**: File path completion after `@` now supports fuzzy matching and shows file/directory indicators.
- **Session Selector with Search**: The `--resume` and `--session` flags now open a searchable session list with fuzzy filtering.
- **Attachment Display**: Files added via `@path` are now shown as "Attached: filename" in the user message, separate from the prompt text.
- **Tab Completion**: Tab key now triggers file path autocompletion anywhere in the editor, not just after `@` symbol.

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete z-order issue where dropdown could appear behind chat messages
- Fixed cursor position when navigating through wrapped lines in the editor
- Fixed attachment handling for continued sessions to preserve file references

## [0.10.6] - 2025-11-28

### Changed

- Show base64-truncated indicator for large images in tool output

### Fixed

- Fixed image dimensions not being read correctly from PNG/JPEG/GIF files
- Fixed PDF images being incorrectly base64-truncated in display
- Allow reading files from ancestor directories (needed for monorepo configs)

## [0.10.5] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- Full multimodal support: attach images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) and PDFs to prompts using `@path` syntax or `--file` flag

### Fixed

- `@`-references now handle special characters in file names (spaces, quotes, unicode)
- Fixed cursor positioning issues with multi-byte unicode characters in editor

## [0.10.4] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed

- Removed padding on first user message in TUI to improve visual consistency.

## [0.10.3] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- Added RPC mode (`--rpc`) for programmatic integration. Accepts JSON commands on stdin, emits JSON events on stdout. See [RPC mode documentation](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/README.md#rpc-mode) for protocol details.

### Changed

- Refactored internal architecture to support multiple frontends (TUI, RPC) with shared agent logic.

## [0.10.2] - 2025-11-26

### Added

- Added thinking level persistence. Default level stored in `~/.pi/settings.json`, restored on startup. Per-session overrides saved in session files.
- Added model cycling shortcut: `Ctrl+I` cycles through available models (or scoped models with `-m` flag).
- Added automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient API errors (network issues, 500s, overload).
- Cumulative token usage now shown in footer (total tokens used across all messages in session).
- Added `--system-prompt` flag to override default system prompt with custom text or file contents.
- Footer now shows estimated total cost in USD based on model pricing.

### Changed

- Replaced `--models` flag with `-m/--model` supporting multiple values. Specify models as `provider/model@thinking` (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514@high`). Multiple `-m` flags scope available models for the session.
- Thinking level border now persists visually after selector closes.
- Improved tool result display with collapsible output (default collapsed, expand with `Ctrl+O`).

## [0.10.1] - 2025-11-25
