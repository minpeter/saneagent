# terminal builtin extension — fork surface

## Foreground git commands stay non-interactive (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- `shared.ts`: `FOREGROUND_ENV_OVERRIDES` gains two keys. `GIT_EDITOR: "true"` makes git spawn `/usr/bin/true` as the editor for foreground one-shot commands — git treats a zero-exit editor as accepted, so a `git commit` without `-m` aborts with `Aborting commit due to empty commit message` and a `git rebase -i` takes the todo list as-is instead of parking the captured PTY inside nvim on COMMIT_EDITMSG. `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT: "0"` makes git fail fast on credential prompts (exit 128, `could not read Username`) — the same opt-out `package-manager.ts` uses for its own git calls. Background PTY sessions still spawn with only `sessionEnvOverrides` (`runBackground` in `tools/bash.ts`), so interactive git in a background session keeps the user's real settings.

### Why

- Child agents and foreground one-shot commands run with a captured PTY: when git opens an editor or asks for credentials on that terminal nobody can type, and the tool blocks until the timeout kills the command. The existing foreground overrides already removed color/pager interactivity; the editor and credential prompts were the two remaining terminal-input paths.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The overrides are injected by this builtin's own `runForeground` spawn path from its shared constants; an outside extension cannot alter the environment of a PTY the terminal manager spawns.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `FOREGROUND_ENV_OVERRIDES` constant and its doc comment in `shared.ts`, plus the foreground/background env assertions in `test/terminal-bash-tool-output.test.ts`.

## File monitors resolve parent identity without realpath and gate `fs.watch` behind a bounded open (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `monitor-registry.ts`: the five `fs.promises.realpath` calls (approved parent at registration, target identity after open, activation parent before `watch`, and both re-checks in `#checkFileImpl`) now use `realpathWithoutOpen` from `src/utils/paths.ts` — the lstat/readlink walker the permission parser uses for the approved parent, so both sides compute the same string by construction.
- Immediately before the synchronous `fs.watch(parent)`, registration awaits `probeDirectoryOpenable(parent)` (`src/utils/fs-watch.ts`: `opendir` + one `read` + `close`) through `#registrationAwait`, so a directory whose open never returns fails the registration at `timeoutMs` instead of blocking the host main thread inside `watch()`.
- The watch target goes through `canonicalWatchPath` (`src/utils/fs-watch.ts`), which resolves `realpathSync.native` on Windows only; that keeps the issue #1229 guarantee (libuv aborts on a non-canonical 8.3 directory watch) without touching realpath on POSIX.

### Why

- Bun implements every `fs.realpath*` by `open(2)`-ing each directory. On a macOS host whose autofs automounter is wedged, `realpath("/home")` never returns: on the permission parser's main-thread call that froze the TUI (#1416 follow-up), and in the registry it parked a pool thread until the deadline. With the parser no longer opening anything, the registry had to switch too — Bun's realpath canonicalises case, the walker preserves it, and the TOCTOU checks compare the two strings for equality.
- Removing realpath from the registry would otherwise have let a wedged parent reach `fs.watch`, which opens the directory synchronously on the main thread; the bounded `opendir` probe restores the deadline that the async realpath used to provide.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The registry and the permission parser are both fork builtins; the approved-parent handshake between them is internal.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `monitor-registry.ts` imports, `registerFile` (parent identity, target identity, activation + `watch`), `#checkFileImpl` re-checks.
- `src/utils/fs-watch.ts` (`canonicalWatchPath`, `probeDirectoryOpenable`; `watchWithErrorHandler` now delegates its win32 canonicalisation).
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-parent-resolution.test.ts` (new: registration with realpath rejecting, deadline on a non-openable parent, parser/registry symlink agreement, swapped-parent rejection).

## `persistent` reads as the standing-watch switch (2026-09-04)

### What changed

- `tools/monitor.ts`: the `persistent` parameter description now states the whole durable contract in one breath — no deadline, survives a session restart (the command re-run once, the file rescanned with any detached change reported), expires 7 days after creation, at most 5 per session, stop one with `kill_bash`. `timeout_ms` says "ignored when persistent" instead of naming "persistent monitors" again, and the tool's top-level description was compressed to the branch contract (`command` XOR `path`, what each injects, `create` firing only on appearance, `filter` rejected on the path branch, `bash_id` returned immediately) — the dedup, restart and one-shot-gate teaching it duplicated already lives in `prompt.ts`. No new parameter and no new action value.
- `prompt.ts`: the path-branch call shape gains `persistent?`, the false "takes no `persistent`" clause is gone, and one added sentence teaches the standing watch: `persistent: true`, no deadline, survives a restart, 7-day expiry, capped at 5, accounted for in the one restart-report line on session start.
- Docs brought in line: `docs/terminal-tools.md` gains a "Standing watches" section (stable `mon_` id, per-class restore behavior, the one restore sentence with its real clause shapes, the 5/7-day caps, foreign-live-process case) and three anti-pattern rows; `AGENTS.md` documents the five durability modules and the four invariants (`persistent` = durable, ONE digest per restart, transition-only writes, runtime-id-only pause/resume/rearm).

### Measured prompt budget

- `monitor.ts` `description:` literals: **1630 → 1342 bytes** (ceiling 1476; P2/P3 had breached it by 154 while adding durability wording).
- `buildTerminalPromptSection({ evalOnly: false })`: **2523 → 2839 bytes** (ceiling 3435). The tool surface paid for its own rewording; the prompt grew only by the one standing-watch sentence.

### Fixed false doc claims

- Both `prompt.ts` and `docs/terminal-tools.md` claimed the native file branch takes no `persistent`. That has been wrong since the `checkpointed-file` durability class landed: a persistent file watch is exactly what is checkpointed and restored. Both now show `persistent?` on the path branch.

### Why

- `persistent` was described as "keep watching until the command exits or kill_bash stops its bash_id" — a lifetime hint that says nothing about the durability the flag actually buys, while the bounds that make it safe to hand to a model (7-day expiry, cap of 5) lived only in the source. The switch has to read as what it is, and it has to do so without growing the per-turn prompt: the same guidance was being paid for twice, once in the tool schema and once in the terminal prompt section.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both surfaces are this builtin's own: the parameter descriptions are its TypeBox schema and the section is its prompt contribution. Nothing outside can reword them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `tools/monitor.ts` description literals and the `monitor` bullet in `prompt.ts` are fork-only prose; the docs are fork-only files.

## Prompt section renders the reachable bash/monitor call form (2026-09-03)

### What changed

- `prompt.ts`: the `TERMINAL_PROMPT_SECTION` constant becomes `buildTerminalPromptSection({ evalOnly })`. Under `evalOnly` the `bash` and `monitor` call shapes render as `tool.bash(` / `tool.monitor(` (including both create branches and the `rearm` shapes); otherwise the direct shapes are unchanged. The steering companions `bash_output`, `bash_input`, `bash_resize` and `kill_bash` keep their direct shapes in both branches because the policy never withholds them.
- `extension.ts`: the `before_agent_start` handler calls the builder with `evalOnly: isEvalOnlyRouting(pi)`.

### Why

- This section is appended to the system prompt unconditionally, so its hardcoded direct shapes taught a call the model cannot make in any session that routes shell tools through eval cells. A prompt that describes an impossible call is worse than a silent one.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The section is this builtin's own prompt surface; only it can render the branch its tools are registered under.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `prompt.ts` is a fork-only surface; the `extension.ts` change is a single handler line.

## bash_output muted-monitor metadata (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- `bash_output` looks up the peeked `bash_id` in `monitorRegistry.snapshot()`. When that monitor is paused, it prepends a concise muted note (including `mutedDropped` when lines were dropped) to both log and screen results and attaches `{ monitorMuted, mutedDropped }` details. Non-monitor sessions are unchanged: no note, no monitor details.

### Why

- The one-shot pause notice can scroll away or disappear after compaction, and the footer is not in the model's textual context. `bash_output` is a surface the model reads directly, so muted state and the dropped-line count need to stay legible there without altering runtime history.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `bash_output` is the builtin peek surface over the terminal manager and monitor registry; only it can prepend the note onto the result the model reads.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `tools/bash-output.ts` and `test/suite/terminal-monitor.test.ts`.

## Muted monitor dropped-line counts (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- Filter-matching complete lines received while a command monitor is muted are counted and reported when the monitor is re-armed; the count resets on resume.

### Why

- A re-arm report tells the agent how much matching output it missed without retaining or replaying dropped text.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The monitor registry owns line consumption, pause state, and the re-arm lifecycle.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `monitor-registry.ts`, `tools/monitor.ts`, and terminal monitor tests.

## Monitor footer muted label (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- The monitor footer now renders paused monitors as `muted` or `N muted`.
- The `paused` wire field remains unchanged.

### Why

- `muted` communicates temporary silencing without implying that the monitor is frozen or stuck.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The footer formatter owns the human-readable monitor status label.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `monitor-status.ts` and terminal monitor footer tests.

## External user input resumes paused monitors (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- Interactive and RPC user input now resumes all paused monitors and clears their notifier delivery bookkeeping; extension-generated input and tool calls remain streak-reset-only and do not resume monitors.

### Why

- Real user input is an intentional re-engagement signal, while agent-owned activity must preserve wake-storm protection.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The authoritative monitor registry and notifier delivery bookkeeping are private to the builtin terminal extension's session state.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `extension.ts` input handling, `prompt.ts`, and the terminal monitor external-resume regression test.

## Scoped monitor wake-budget pauses (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- Monitor pause state is authoritative in the registry; wake-budget exhaustion pauses only the noisy monitor(s) that contributed to that injection. Rearming one monitor or all paused monitors clears delivery bookkeeping so intermediate events resume correctly.

### Why

- A global notifier pause could mute quiet monitors permanently after a noisy monitor exhausted the shared wake budget.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The registry owns monitor lifecycle and pause state, while the notifier owns wake-budget batching and deduplication; only the builtin terminal extension coordinates both.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `monitor-registry.ts`, `monitor-notify.ts`, `tools/monitor.ts`, `extension.ts`, and terminal monitor tests.


## Teach the monitor file branch on every prompt surface (2026-09-02)

### What changed

- `prompt.ts`: the monitor bullet now states `command` XOR `path` and documents both branches.
  It previously published the signature as
  `monitor({ description, command, filter?, timeout_ms?, persistent? })`, which omitted the file
  branch added on 2026-08-29 and presented `command` as unconditionally required.
- `tools/monitor.ts`: the tool `description` and `promptSnippet` no longer scope the tool to a
  command's output, and the schema branch labels are symmetric — `command` reads
  "Create, command branch (XOR path)" and `path` reads "Create, file branch (XOR command)".
  Previously `command` claimed "Create (required)" while `path` carried no branch label at all,
  so the prose asserted a requirement that `execute` does not enforce.
- `docs/terminal-tools.md`: the "File or port transition" recipe is split. Awaiting a file is now
  the native `path` branch; the sleep loop survives only in the port recipe, which has no native
  watch. The summary Tools table row now shows `command` XOR `path` instead of a command-only
  signature, and anti-pattern rows cover polling `test -f`, passing both branches, and using the
  default `create` event on a file that already exists.
- Every file-branch surface states that `create` fires only when the file appears after
  registration. `registerFile` records `present: initial !== null` and the create predicate is
  `!record.present && present`, so a `create` watch on an already-existing file can never fire and
  silently waits out its timeout; that surface needs `event: "modify"`.
- The same surfaces state the branch's registration preconditions, because `registerFile` rejects
  a missing parent directory, a symlink, and a non-regular file outright. Recommending it as a
  drop-in for `test -f` polling was wrong for the common case of awaiting a build artifact whose
  directory the build itself creates; that case keeps a `command` poll loop.
- Deleted the trailing "Typical flow" paragraph in `prompt.ts`: it restated the bullets above it
  and duplicated the bash_output completion-notification sentence verbatim.

### Why

- The 2026-08-29 feature landed in the schema and in `execute` but in no narrative surface. Models
  following the prompt literally do not generalize a documented `command` signature into an
  undocumented `path` branch, and the XOR rule existed only in a runtime error string. An agent
  reading these surfaces concluded that the schema forced both `command` and `path`, declared
  monitor impossible to register, and fell back to a background bash session — losing event
  injection, dedup, and rearm for no reason. Nothing in the schema marks any field required:
  every property is `Type.Optional` and no provider conversion adds `required`
  (`tool-schema-compat.ts` only narrows it to the intersection of branches).
- `test/monitor-branch-prompt-surface.test.ts` locks the gap class: every create-branch schema
  property must appear on the shipped prompt surfaces, each branch must show its own
  `monitor({ ... })` call shape, and the file branch's `modify` caveat must accompany it wherever
  it is taught. Bare name presence alone is too weak — deleting the file-branch bullet still
  leaves `path` in the XOR sentence and `filter`/`persistent` in its negation — so the call-shape
  assertion is what actually detects a dropped branch. It keys on schema properties and call
  shapes, never on prose wording.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- These are the builtin's own tool description, prompt section, and shipped docs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the monitor bullet in `prompt.ts`, the `description`/`promptSnippet`/schema labels in
  `tools/monitor.ts`, and the monitor recipe list in `docs/terminal-tools.md`.


## Add native one-shot file monitors (2026-08-29)

### What changed

- `monitor({ path, event: "create" | "modify" })` now watches a file with a `watch_N` identity.
- Native watches serialize reconciliation and settlement, handle watcher errors, fence registration during teardown/reload, preserve paused transitions, validate regular files and access errors, detect content-preserving rewrites, share promptly reconciled terminal capacity, use external-directory approval for external paths, and revalidate the approved canonical parent before registration to close symlink retargeting races. Fingerprints sample the first, middle, and last 64 KiB; duplicate hints are coalesced into at most one trailing reconciliation pass per burst, while the 250 ms poll remains the stable-state backstop.

### Why

- Native monitors must deliver exactly once and remain safe across cancellation, reload, permission boundaries, filesystem timestamp limitations, and terminal capacity churn. Replacements that expose a symlink or a hardlink to an already-unrelated inode fail closed; a regular-file rename with `nlink === 1` is indistinguishable from a safe atomic save under this predicate and may be reported as `modify`. A theoretically reusable `(dev, ino)` tuple (inode ABA) cannot be distinguished by this bounded identity check; an observed delete is handled as absence, while an unobserved ABA window is outside the filesystem guarantees of this native monitor.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The watcher, stat reconciliation, lifecycle ownership, and shared terminal reservation are private to the builtin terminal extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `monitor-registry.ts`, `manager.ts`, and the native monitor regression suite.


## Monitor snapshots cross the RPC wire (2026-08-28)

### What changed

- `extension.ts`: the monitor-state sink now builds one payload and publishes it
  on both `pi.events` (`terminal_monitor_state`, consumed in-process by goal)
  and `pi.rpc.emit` so JSONL RPC clients receive `{ type: "extension_event",
  name: "terminal_monitor_state", data }` when they advertise `extension_events`.

### Why

- Ordinary `pi.events` channels are never forwarded over RPC. Desktop and other
  RPC hosts could not observe live monitor snapshots without this second emit.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The authoritative monitor registry is private to the terminal builtin; only
  this sink sees the snapshot.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `extension.ts` `onMonitorState` sink next to the existing `pi.events.emit`.

## Align terminal bash environment guidance (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- Matched the terminal extension's bash prompt guideline to the core tool:
  `You can inspect PI_* environment variables for current model and session
  details.`

### Why

- The default terminal extension replaces the core bash tool, so stale wording
  otherwise overrides the canonical SDK prompt contract.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This is the builtin extension's own registered tool description.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `tools/bash.ts`, in `promptGuidelines`.

## Burst-aware monitor pauses force a wake (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- The monitor wake budget now counts a burst of actual model-visible injections instead of accumulating every update since the last user or tool action. A strict gap greater than twice the resolved monitor rate limit resets the streak before the next nonduplicate batch consumes budget.
- Deferred and byte-identical batches do not update the streak timestamp. The existing budget, sticky pause, summary delivery, fresh-monitor reset, and explicit rearm behavior remain unchanged.
- The batch that reaches the wake budget now forces `steer` delivery when terminal notifications use `next-turn`. Ordinary `next-turn` monitor updates remain follow-ups, while `off`, noninteractive modes, and sessions without an active model remain suppressed.

### Why

A real `gh pr checks --watch --interval 30` monitor delivered useful progress snapshots (`5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 13 -> 14` successful checks) over several minutes. The previous lifetime counter treated those widely spaced updates as one unbroken wake storm and paused after five injections. Raising the budget would only postpone the same failure while weakening protection against actual bursts.

When a true burst does exhaust the budget, entering the sticky paused state is an actionable session-state change. It must wake the main session immediately even when ordinary monitor notifications are configured to wait for the next turn.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

The streak counter, duplicate suppression, rate-limit readiness, pause transition, and hidden message delivery mode are private state inside the builtin terminal notifier. An extension or wrapper command cannot distinguish actual injections from deferred or suppressed batches, nor can it upgrade only the pause-triggering hidden message from follow-up to steer without bypassing terminal notification guards.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `monitor-notify.ts` around the notifier's wake-budget state and `#flush()` injection boundary.
- `notify.ts` around the internal `TerminalNotificationDelivery.send` options and `deliverAs` selection.
- `terminal-monitor-notify.test.ts` and `terminal-monitor-dup-suppression.test.ts` around wake-budget timing assertions.

## Terminal wake-source snapshots (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- Monitor snapshots now publish `wake_source_state` under `terminal-monitors` while permanently retaining the legacy `terminal_monitor_state` emission.
- The bundle-owned active background-session set publishes `terminal-background-sessions` on explicit background launch, foreground detach, exit, kill, teardown, and session rebind.

### Why

Goal continuation must count every terminal activity that can wake or unblock the session, not only monitor watches, using the same source-keyed contract as other packages.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

The authoritative monitor registry and background-session lifecycle are private to the terminal builtin and its reload-surviving session bundle.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `extension.ts` and `session-bundle.ts` around snapshot sinks and reload replay.

## Native PTY waits no longer exhaust the libuv threadpool (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- `crates/senpi-pty/src/lib.rs`: `waitExit()` and `wait()` now obtain the existing waiter
  synchronously, create a N-API deferred promise, and join the waiter on a named private Rust
  reaper thread. The reaper resolves or rejects the deferred only after the waiter has completed
  its existing child wait and reader-drain sequence.
- Native lifecycle regressions start six pending waits with `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=1` and prove DNS,
  filesystem, and PBKDF2 work still completes; a companion tears down a Worker environment while
  its native wait is pending and proves the process exits naturally after the PTY child is killed.

### Why

The prior N-API `AsyncTask` ran `JoinHandle::join()` on a libuv worker for the PTY child's entire
lifetime. Enough long-lived terminal sessions exhausted the shared pool and indefinitely queued
unrelated DNS and filesystem work, which could leave provider requests and the terminal UI stuck.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

The blocked worker was owned by the Rust-to-N-API promise implementation below the TypeScript PTY
facade. An extension cannot move native wait completion off libuv or safely settle a promise after
native reader teardown.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `crates/senpi-pty/src/lib.rs` around `NativePtySession::waitExit` / `wait` and native promise
  settlement.
- `packages/pty/test/native-wait-threadpool.test.ts` and its native subprocess fixtures.


## Terminal monitor and background-bash resumption channels (2026-08-08)

### What changed

- Monitor registry transitions still emit the byte-compatible `terminal_monitor_state` payload and
  now also emit the shared `resumption_channel_state` snapshot under source
  `"terminal-monitor"`, with matching counts and channel identity metadata.
- `TerminalSessionBundle` now owns the live background-session snapshot. Explicit background bash
  launches and foreground auto-detaches register a channel, while exit, `kill_bash`, and bundle
  teardown remove it. Every transition emits the complete source snapshot under
  `"terminal-bash"`.
- Bundle binding re-publishes both monitor and background snapshots during `session_start`, including
  after reload, so a goal consumer that clears session-scoped counts sees channels that remained
  alive across the boundary.

### Notification tradeoff

Background sessions count as live resumption channels unconditionally, including non-interactive
sessions and terminal `notify: "off"`. The notify setting controls whether completion injects a wake
notification; it does not change whether work is still alive. A muted session can therefore delay a
goal continuation even though its completion will not wake the agent, but the existing four-minute
continuation backstop bounds that delay. Keeping liveness independent from notification policy avoids
the measured 53ms premature continuation seen with `notify: "off"` (52ms with notifications enabled).

## Fixed foreground window replaces cache budget; sleep-wait commands detach early (2026-08-07)

### What changed

- `tools/foreground-window.ts` (new): the foreground blocking window is a fixed value —
  `PI_BASH_FOREGROUND_SECONDS`, default 60s (`DEFAULT_FOREGROUND_WINDOW_SECONDS`) — no longer
  tied to the prompt-cache safe-wait budget. A classified sleep-wait uses a shorter 5s window
  (`SLEEP_WAIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`) because its remaining time is pure waiting with nothing to show.
  `resolveForegroundWindowSeconds(env)` parses the env override with a positive-finite guard,
  falling back to the default.
- `tools/sleep-wait.ts` (new): `classifySleepWait(command)` detects four wait-shaped patterns —
  R1 bare `sleep N`, R2 leading `sleep N; cmd`, R3 polling loop (`while`/`until`/`for` containing
  `sleep`), R4 trailing `cmd; sleep N` — after stripping `bash -lc` / `env A=1 sh -c` wrappers
  (up to three levels deep via `unwrap()`). `longestSleepSeconds()` extracts the largest `sleep`
  argument. A 10s threshold (`SLEEP_WAIT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`) keeps short settle sleeps like
  `pkill; sleep 1` foreground; inside a loop the threshold drops to 2s
  (`SLEEP_WAIT_LOOP_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`). The `POWER_MANAGEMENT` guard (`pmset`/`caffeinate`/
  `systemsetup`/`displaysleep`/`disksleep`) prevents power-management arguments from matching.
- `tools/bash.ts`: `resolveAutoDetachDelayMs` takes a new `sleepWait: SleepWaitClassification |
  undefined` parameter and returns the sleep-wait window (5s) when classified, otherwise the
  foreground window (60s). The old `ctx.getSessionContext?.()?.getPromptCacheSafeWaitSeconds?.()`
  budget call is removed. `runForeground` calls `classifySleepWait(input.command)` before resolving
  the detach delay. A sleep-wait detach gets a dedicated `guidance` string that tells the model to
  end its turn and wait for the completion notification — explicitly not to poll
  `bash_output` — and recommends `monitor({command, filter})` for pattern waits. Non-sleep-wait
  detaches keep the existing guidance. The tool result `details` gains `sleep_wait: true` for
  classified commands. The `timeout` schema description and the bash tool `description` are
  rewritten to describe the window + auto-detach + kill-deadline semantics.
- Auto-detach mechanism is unchanged: `createForegroundDetachGate` + `scheduleDetachedSweep` move
  a still-running process to a live background session, and `timeout` remains the process kill
  deadline enforced after detach.

### Why

A census of real local coding-agent session stores found ~7,073 sleep-wait bash commands — poll
loops, `sleep 45; gh pr view ...`, bare `sleep 30` — where agents burned foreground turn time on
waiting. The runtime now hands such waits to the background instead of blocking or killing them:
a sleep-wait detaches at 5s, an ordinary command still running at the 60s window detaches then.
The completion notification delivers exit status and output tail, so polling `bash_output` is
unnecessary.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The foreground window replaces the session-context `getPromptCacheSafeWaitSeconds` hook that
  only the built-in `bash` tool reads inside `runForeground`. An extension cannot intercept the
  foreground wait lifecycle, inject a per-command classification before the detach gate commits,
  or author the handoff `guidance` message that `runForeground` returns.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `tools/bash.ts` `resolveAutoDetachDelayMs` (signature change, budget removal) and the
  detached-result `guidance` block where the sleep-wait message branch lives.
- `tools/foreground-window.ts` and `tools/sleep-wait.ts` (new fork-owned files; upstream has no
  equivalent).
- `test/suite/sleep-wait.test.ts` (new) and `test/suite/terminal-bash-auto-detach.test.ts`
  (`setup()` drops `safeWaitSeconds`, describe block renamed to "foreground window auto-detach").

## Paused monitors still deliver completion (2026-08-04)

### What changed

- `MonitorNotifier.notifyEvent()` keeps dropping intermediate line events after the
  session wake budget pauses live monitors, but a terminal summary now releases the
  notifier pause, resets the consecutive-wake streak, and bypasses the prior line
  injection's rate-limit timestamp. Summary delivery does not consume the wake budget
  or emit another pause notice after the monitor has exited.
- The wake-budget notice now says completion still wakes automatically and limits
  explicit rearm guidance to callers that need intermediate events.
- A regression exhausts the wake budget, proves another line stays suppressed, and
  then proves the same monitor's completion wakes the session without `rearm()`.

### Why

- Session `019fceb6-df3a-7a90-ac5f-cfcb0de5fba2` used a noisy `gh run watch`
  monitor. The wake budget correctly paused repeated status updates, but the notifier
  also discarded the monitor's exit summary. The agent therefore had to rearm to learn
  completion, which reset the wake budget and recreated the wake loop.
- A paused monitor is still a live resumption channel. Pausing must suppress
  intermediate noise without hiding the terminal event the session is waiting for.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Wake-budget state, notification rate limits, and monitor summaries meet inside the
  built-in session-scoped `MonitorNotifier`; extensions cannot intercept or reorder
  that delivery transition.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `monitor-notify.ts` around `notifyEvent()`, wake-budget wording, and the
  notification regression tests.

## Fresh monitors reset a spent wake budget (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- Creating a monitor now resets the session-global monitor notification pause before
  the new runtime can emit output or its completion summary.
- A regression drives a real monitor after a prior watch exhausts the wake budget and
  proves the fresh monitor's completion still triggers a model-visible wake.

### Why

- The wake budget intentionally pauses noisy watches, but that pause previously leaked
  into later monitors. A newly requested watch could run and disappear from the TUI
  without delivering its completion, leaving deferred goal work looking stopped.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The fix depends on the built-in monitor tool's ordering relative to the
  session-scoped notifier and monitor registry.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `tools/monitor.ts` around monitor creation and `tools/context.ts` around notifier
  callbacks.
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-notify.test.ts` around wake-budget coverage.

## Backfill: Anthropic availability monitoring (2026-08-01)

### What changed

- Persistent terminal monitoring recognizes Anthropic availability and reports it through the existing observable-state channel.

### Why

- Agents must distinguish a provider becoming usable from arbitrary terminal output.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The signal is produced inside the built-in monitor process and terminal event parser.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Monitor event parsing, provider availability matching, and terminal status tests.

The persistent-terminal tool suite (`bash` swapped to PTY-backed + `bash_output`,
`kill_bash`, `bash_input`, `bash_resize`). Backed by `@earendil-works/pi-pty`.

## Duplicate monitor batches no longer re-wake the session (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- `monitor-notify.ts`: `MonitorNotifier.#flush` now fingerprints each ready monitor's
  line-only batch (joined sanitized bodies) and compares it with that monitor's previous
  injection. A byte-identical batch is dropped silently: no injection, no wake, no
  wake-budget tick, and `#lastInjectionAt` is left untouched so a real change delivers at
  the next flush. Fingerprints are recorded per monitor on every actual injection,
  cleared on `rearm` and `dispose`, and skipped entirely for batches containing a
  summary (exit) event or overflow, which always deliver.
- `tools/monitor.ts`: the tool description now tells the model that unchanged repeats
  are dropped instead of re-waking the session.
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-notify-harness.ts` (new): the `FakeScheduler` +
  `createNotifier` fixtures extracted from `terminal-monitor-notify.test.ts`, shared with
  the new `terminal-monitor-dup-suppression.test.ts` describe cluster (dup drop, change
  wake, multi-line batch, per-monitor independence, summary exemption, wake-budget
  neutrality, rearm reset).

### Why

Observed live (session 019fb7da-e8a1, "watching PR 603 CI checks"): a
`gh pr checks --watch --interval 10` monitor with a status filter reprinted the same
summary every refresh, waking the idle session every ~10.5s for byte-identical content
(29 injections, only 14 unique bodies; each wake replayed ~240K cached context). The
wake budget paused the flood every 5 wakes, but each explicit rearm reset it and the
cycle repeated. Waking a full-context session for zero new information is waste the
harness can prevent deterministically.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: fork-owned `monitor-notify.ts` flush path and the monitor tool description.

## Live elapsed footer for monitors + enriched monitor state event (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- `monitor-registry.ts`: `MonitorSnapshotEntry` gains `startedAtMs` (epoch ms at registration).
- `monitor-status.ts`: `formatMonitorStatus(snapshot, nowMs)` renders a goal-style compact
  elapsed label (`5s`/`3m`/`2h 30m`) for the oldest live watch, merged with the paused suffix
  as `(3m, paused)` / `(3m, 1 paused)`. 48-char budget and `+N more` packing unchanged.
- `monitor-status-ticker.ts` (new): `MonitorStatusTicker` mirrors the goal builtin's
  `GoalElapsedTicker` — 1s unref'd interval, renders only when the formatted label changes,
  stops and clears the status when the last watch settles. The extension's `onMonitorState`
  sink now drives the ticker instead of formatting inline; `session_shutdown` stops it.
- `builtin/monitor-state-event.ts`: `TerminalMonitorStateEvent` gains an additive optional
  `monitors` array (`{ id, description, paused, startedAtMs }`) so event-bus consumers (and
  RPC clients, which already receive footer statuses through the `setStatus`
  `extension_ui_request` bridge) can render their own elapsed views. `activeCount` and the
  type guard are unchanged; old payloads still validate.

### Tests

- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-footer.test.ts`: elapsed rendering, oldest-watch selection,
  clock-skew clamp, paused-suffix merge, budget preservation, `startedAtMs` in snapshots.
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-status-ticker.test.ts` (new): unref'd 1s interval, label
  dedupe, stop-on-settle, re-sync without leaking intervals.
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-state-event.test.ts`: `monitors[]` payload assertions.

## Background sessions and monitors survive session reload (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `session-bundle.ts` (new): `TerminalSessionBundle` owns the long-lived per-session runtime
  (the `TerminalManager` plus the `MonitorRegistry`) and routes monitor events, monitor-state
  snapshots, and background-exit notifications through mutable sinks the current extension
  instance binds. A module-level parked map (`parkBundle`/`claimParkedBundle`/
  `teardownParkedBundle`, keyed by `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionId()`, at most one parked
  bundle per session) hands the bundle across the extension-runner replacement a reload performs.
- `extension.ts`: `session_shutdown` with `reason:"reload"` parks the bundle instead of tearing
  it down; every other reason (`quit`/`new`/`resume`/`fork`) keeps the full teardown AND sweeps
  any stale parked bundle. `session_start` with `reason:"reload"` claims the parked bundle,
  re-binds sinks to the new instance's notifiers, re-publishes the `monitors` footer status, and
  flushes events buffered during the reload window (bounded: 100 monitor events, 32 exits);
  other reasons keep today's fresh-bundle behavior. `onBackgroundExit` now dispatches through
  the bundle so exit listeners registered before a reload reach the post-reload notifier.
- Result: after `/reload`, existing `bash_N` ids remain addressable (`bash_output`,
  `bash_input`, `kill_bash`), monitors keep injecting events, and background completion
  notifications reach the new runner instead of dying with the old one. Previously reload
  tree-killed every background session and orphaned every watcher the model knew about.
- Known bounds: terminal `maxSessions`/`scrollback` setting changes apply to bundles created
  after a non-reload session start (a preserved bundle keeps its construction-time caps); a
  headless host that skips `session_start` after reload leaves the bundle parked until the next
  real shutdown sweep.
- Tests: `test/suite/terminal-reload-survival.test.ts` (monitor survival + footer re-publish,
  background-session id survival via screen peek, post-reload completion-notification routing,
  quit-teardown characterization pin).

### Why

Observed live: a reload during an active `gh pr checks --watch` monitor orphaned the watcher
(process kept running, session lost the subscription, footer went blank, all bash ids dangled).
Waiting state parked behind a reload must keep waiting, cleanly.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: fork-owned `extension.ts` session lifecycle handlers and the new `session-bundle.ts`.

## Theme-aware active-monitor footer (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- Active monitor footer text is wrapped with the current TUI theme's `text` foreground and
  `selectedBg` background before publication through `ctx.ui.setStatus`.
- Styling is restricted to `ctx.mode === "tui"`; RPC, app-server, JSON, and print contexts keep
  the original plain status string, and an empty monitor snapshot still clears with `undefined`.
- The formatter remains unchanged, so the 48-column cap, whole-description packing, watch glyph,
  monitor count, and paused suffix stay independent of ANSI byte length.

### Why

The live `◉ watching …` row could blend into adjacent footer content. Reusing the active theme's
selection background creates a visible but restrained chip in both dark and light themes without
introducing a monitor-specific color token.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: the fork-owned monitor registry `onChange` callback in `extension.ts` and its focused footer
  wiring test.

## bash_output ghost wait_for params removed (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `bash_output` no longer exposes the `wait_for`, `block`, and `timeout` params,
  and the `BASH_OUTPUT_WAIT_REMOVED_GUIDANCE` migration string and
  `GHOST_PARAM_DESCRIPTION` were removed from `tools/bash-output.ts`.
- `BashOutputInput` is now exactly `{ bash_id, filter?, view? }`; any caller still
  sending the removed params gets a generic schema-validation error instead of
  the migration text.
- Tests that pinned the ghost guidance were removed:
  - `test/bash-output-peek.test.ts` `describe("bash_output removed blocking params")` block.
  - `test/suite/terminal-extension.test.ts` `it("wait_for ghost param returns migration guidance …")`.
  - `test/prompt-surface-stale-wait-idioms.test.ts` `it("the ghost guidance exists …")`.
- The negative guards in `prompt-surface-stale-wait-idioms.test.ts` (no surface
  teaches `wait_for` / `block until` / tmux backgrounding) stay in place.

### Why

The ghost params kept the removed `wait_for` idiom visible to the model in the
schema, so it kept being called and returning the guidance text — the migration
message never stopped appearing. Dropping the params from the schema removes the
mention entirely; the monitor/notification model in `terminal/prompt.ts` and
`docs/terminal-tools.md` is already the single taught path.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: fork-owned `bash_output` schema and the removed ghost-param tests.

## Hidden agent wake notifications (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- Terminal completion and monitor-event notifications now use `display:false` custom messages
  with `triggerTurn:true`, preserving idle wake and streaming steer/follow-up behavior without
  rendering synthetic `<system-reminder>` blocks as user input.
- Monitor events use `senpi-monitor:notification`; background terminal completion notices use
  `senpi-terminal:notification`.
- App-server extension turns may bootstrap from a custom-message wake, but custom wakes do not
  emit a visible `userMessage` item.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: fork-owned terminal notification delivery wiring and app-server extension-turn bootstrap.

## Cache-aware foreground timeout promotion (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `TerminalToolContext.timeoutAction` now receives the resolved terminal setting from
  `extension.ts`; the previously declared `terminal.timeoutAction` setting is implemented.
- Foreground `bash` calls whose native timeout exceeds the live prompt-cache-safe wait budget
  auto-detach at that budget when `timeoutAction` is `background`. The original native timeout
  remains authoritative, and a bounded post-timeout sweep preserves the existing teardown path.
- Detach consumes the output delta once, wires the normal background completion notifier, and
  returns the persistent `bash_N` handle with instructions for output and termination.

### Why

A foreground wait beyond the prompt-cache-safe deadline risks invalidating the prompt cache.
Promotion preserves the command and its original kill deadline while returning control to the
agent before that cache deadline. `timeoutAction: "kill"`, absent cache budgets, and timeouts at
or below the budget retain their existing foreground behavior.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `tools/bash.ts` foreground lifecycle and `extension.ts` tool-context getters.

## Footer status for active monitors (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `monitor-registry.ts`: `MonitorRegistry` accepts optional `MonitorRegistryOptions.onChange`, fired
  with a `snapshot()` (`{id, description, paused}[]`) on register, pauseAll (when any paused),
  rearm, settle, and dispose. `snapshot()` is public.
- `monitor-status.ts` (new): `formatMonitorStatus(snapshot)` — undefined when nothing is watched
  (clears the footer status), `watching <desc>` for one, `watching N: <d1>, <d2>` elided to a
  48-char cap for many, `(paused)` / `(k paused)` markers. `MONITOR_STATUS_KEY = "monitors"`.

### Count-forward visibility rework (2026-07-28)

- `formatMonitorStatus` now leads with the `◉` watch glyph (session-selector glyph family) so the
  status is visually distinct from other extension statuses, and packs whole descriptions instead
  of mid-word elision: `◉ watching <desc>` for one, `◉ watching N: <d1>, <d2> +k more` for many.
  The monitor count and the `(paused)` / `(k paused)` suffix always survive truncation; only the
  description list shrinks (whole-name packing first, single-name `…` truncation as last resort).
  48-char cap unchanged. Tests updated in `test/suite/terminal-monitor-footer.test.ts`.
- `extension.ts`: the session monitor registry is created with an onChange that publishes
  `ctx.ui.setStatus(MONITOR_STATUS_KEY, formatMonitorStatus(snapshot))` — the goal-builtin
  footer-status pattern. Non-interactive modes no-op via the optional ctx; settle/shutdown
  dispose clears the status.
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-footer.test.ts` (new): formatter cases, registry transition
  notifications (register/pause/rearm/settle/dispose with real pipe-forced sessions), and
  extension wiring (fake pi + ui.setStatus spy, real monitor tool execution).

### Why extension system could handle this

- Entirely extension-owned: `ctx.ui.setStatus` is the established footer surface
  (goal/websearch/webfetch precedent); no core or footer-layout changes.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: fork-owned `monitor-registry.ts` constructor/notify points, `extension.ts`
  monitorRegistry getter, new `monitor-status.ts`.

## Wait-discipline routing: bash surface redirect + guidance dedup (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `tools/bash.ts`: the PTY `bash` tool description now carries the wait redirect — waiting on
  observable state (a build finishing, a server coming up, a log line) is never a sleep/poll
  loop; subscribe with the `monitor` tool instead. The bash surface is where a model actually
  types `sleep 30`, and cross-tool routing in the misused tool's description follows the same
  pattern as the grep→rg snippet rule (`test/bash-prompt-snippet.test.ts`). The upstream core
  bash (`src/core/tools/bash.ts`) is deliberately untouched: its toolset has no monitor, and
  guidance must never name a tool the toolset lacks.
- `tools/monitor.ts`: promptGuidelines collapsed to the single when-to-use decision rule. The
  command-shaping sentence duplicated the TERMINAL_PROMPT_SECTION bullet near-verbatim; each
  aspect is now stated once (decision rule → Tool Guidelines; mechanics → terminal section;
  redirect → bash schema; long-run routing → bash-timeout policy).
- `prompt.ts`: the monitor bullet dropped its embedded when-to-use sentence (kept as the monitor
  tool's guideline) and keeps the subscribe framing plus shaping/filtering/rearm mechanics.
- `test/prompt-surface-stale-wait-idioms.test.ts`: the consistency gate now enumerates every
  registered terminal tool surface (description + promptSnippet + promptGuidelines of bash,
  bash_output, monitor, bash_input, bash_resize, kill_bash) plus the bash-timeout prompt
  section; new gates assert the bash description routes waits to monitor, and that no
  agent-facing terminal surface teaches tmux as the backgrounding mechanism — a tmux mention is
  allowed only when the negation targets tmux itself ("do NOT use tmux"), so "use tmux; never
  X" cannot slip through.
- `test/suite/terminal-monitor-notify.test.ts`: the watcher-discipline case now asserts the
  routing rule at its owning surface (the monitor tool's promptGuidelines) instead of
  TERMINAL_PROMPT_SECTION, and the noise-control match is wrap-tolerant.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `tools/bash.ts` description string, `tools/monitor.ts` promptGuidelines, `prompt.ts`
  monitor bullet, gate-test surface list (all fork-owned).

## Monitor flat schema + subscribe-not-poll prompt (2026-07-27)

### What changed

- `monitorSchema` is now a single flat `Type.Object` (action via a string enum; description,
  command, filter, timeout_ms, persistent, bash_id all optional at schema level). Branch
  requirements moved to runtime: create requires description+command, rearm requires bash_id,
  each returning a clear `errorResult` instead of relying on schema-union validation.
- Why: several provider payload paths rebuild tool schemas from top-level `properties` only
  (Anthropic's legacy input_schema conversion in packages/ai `convertTools`), so the previous
  top-level `Type.Union` reached Claude as an EMPTY schema — the model saw a parameterless
  `monitor` tool and fell back to foreground sleep/poll loops.
- Tool description, promptSnippet, promptGuidelines, and the `prompt.ts` monitor bullet were
  rewritten to event-subscription framing (subscribe-not-poll, command shaped by notification
  count), referencing Claude Code's Monitor tool prompt but far shorter.
- `renderMonitorCall` falls back to command/empty when the now-optional description is absent.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `tools/monitor.ts` (fork-owned tool), `tools/render.ts` label line, `prompt.ts` monitor
  bullet, `test/suite/terminal-monitor.test.ts` new schema/validation cases.

## bash_output peek-only (2026-07-26)

### What changed

- `bash_output` is now a pure non-blocking peek: new output since the last read, the status
  line, or `view:"screen"`. The `wait_for` blocking path (plus `block` and the wait
  `timeout`) is removed from the tool and from `TerminalRuntimeSession` (waiter machinery,
  `waitFor()`, exit-settling) — watchers subscribe through `onOutput` (the monitor path)
  instead of blocking inside a read call.
- `wait_for`, `block`, and `timeout` stay in the schema as deprecated ghost params: passing
  any of them returns `BASH_OUTPUT_WAIT_REMOVED_GUIDANCE`, a one-line migration error that
  redirects pattern watches to `monitor({command, filter})`, names the peek-or-relaunch
  fallback for already-running sessions, and notes completion notifications carry the tail.
- The terminal prompt section, `docs/terminal-tools.md`, the senpi-qa skill, and the
  pty-drive self-test now teach the monitor/notification model; a repo consistency-gate
  test (`test/prompt-surface-stale-wait-idioms.test.ts`) fails on any non-ghost `wait_for`
  teaching in shipped prompt surfaces.

### Why

Corpus mining (875 sessions) showed 76% of `bash_output` calls were `wait_for` waits and
30% were empty polls — the notification channel and the monitor tool already do that work.
`bash_input`, `kill_bash`, `run_in_background`, and the notify pipeline are untouched
(plan: `.omo/plans/eval-exec-merge-and-injection-wakeup.md`, todo 13).

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `tools/bash-output.ts` schema + execute path (fork-owned tool).
- LOW: `runtime-session.ts` (fork-owned class; waiter removal is additive-safe upstream).
- LOW: `prompt.ts` terminal prompt section.

## Monitor watcher sessions (2026-07-26)

### What changed

- Added the PTY-backed `monitor` terminal-extension tool. `monitor({ description, command,
  filter?, timeout_ms?, persistent? })` starts through the existing `TerminalManager` and returns
  its normal `bash_N` id immediately, so `bash_output` remains the bounded peek surface and
  `kill_bash` terminates the same watcher process tree. `action:"rearm"` deliberately reports a
  no-op for a live non-paused monitor; wake-budget pausing and rearming delivery land with the
  notification layer.
- `monitor-registry.ts` line-buffers terminal output with one bounded unfinished line per live
  watcher, emits only complete stdout lines (optionally regex-filtered), and emits one final
  completion/timeout/kill summary. The terminal runtime retains the bounded full output, so
  filtered and overflow lines remain peekable.
- The permission parser classifies monitor commands in the existing `bash` permission class,
  preserving the same approval path as `bash` rather than creating a parallel executor policy.

### Why

Long-running builds, CI, and log tails should report decision-relevant state changes without
polling. Keeping monitor inside the terminal extension is required because its session manager is
session-scoped private state; a shared cross-tool registry would enlarge the fork surface without
improving the handle contract (plan: `.omo/plans/eval-exec-merge-and-injection-wakeup.md`, todo 3).

### Event delivery (2026-07-26)

- `monitor-notify.ts` batches stdout events for two seconds and applies a per-monitor five-second
  injection limit by default. One session queue coalesces simultaneous monitors, caps each message
  at 50 lines / 4KB with a `bash_output` peek reminder for overflow, and bounds retained queue
  state to that one capped batch.
- The existing terminal notification guard and mode mapping are shared: `wake` steers,
  `next-turn` follows up, `off` suppresses, and `print`/`json` plus sessions without a model never
  inject or create an auth-less turn. Five monitor-only wakes add one pause notice to the fifth
  injection and pause live watchers until `monitor({ action:"rearm", bash_id })` explicitly
  resumes delivery.
- `terminal.monitorCoalesceWindowMs`, `monitorRateLimitMs`, `monitorMaxLinesPerInjection`,
  `monitorMaxCharsPerInjection`, and `monitorWakeBudget` tune the coalescing/rate/batch/budget
  limits. Monitor calls render with their description or rearm handle, and the terminal prompt
  teaches decision-relevant watcher output rather than noisy log forwarding.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `extension.ts` terminal tool registration and session teardown.
- LOW: `settings.ts` terminal notification settings shape.
- LOW: `shared.ts` companion tool list and terminal tool constants.

## Payload-rich background completion notifications (2026-07-26)

### What changed

- `notify.ts` `buildNotice()`: the background-session completion notice now embeds the exit
  status (unchanged) AND the final output tail (sanitized via `sanitizeTerminalOutput`,
  tail-capped at `NOTICE_TAIL_MAX_CHARS` = 2000 chars, with a truncation note that the full
  history is still peekable) INSTEAD of the old `Use bash_output({ bash_id: "..." }) to read
  its output` instruction. Notify modes (`wake`/`next-turn`/`off`) and all guards
  (non-interactive `print`/`json` suppression, no auth-less turn spin, once per session id)
  are unchanged. `bash_output` itself is untouched.

### Why

Real session evidence: session `019f79b8-3bec` received the old reminder, dutifully called
`bash_output`, and got `(no new output)` — a wasted round per background completion. The
notification is authoritative; receiving it must make a follow-up read unnecessary
(plan: `.omo/plans/eval-exec-merge-and-injection-wakeup.md`, todo 1 / lane S1).

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `notify.ts` `buildNotice()` body (single function; guards untouched).

## Model-facing output is sanitized and bounded (2026-07-21)

### What changed

- `output-format.ts` (new): `sanitizeTerminalOutput()` strips ANSI escape sequences (OSC/CSI/
  designate/single-char) and folds carriage-return/backspace redraw semantics so spinner and
  progress frames collapse to their final visible state; `formatTerminalToolOutput()` then
  tail-truncates to the core-bash budget (`TERMINAL_TOOL_MAX_LINES` 2000 / `TERMINAL_TOOL_MAX_BYTES`
  50 KB via `core/tools/truncate.ts`) with an "earlier output dropped" marker.
- `tools/bash.ts`: foreground results now go through `formatTerminalToolOutput()` instead of
  returning the raw scrollback (up to 1 MB of ANSI soup) verbatim; truncated results carry
  `details.truncation`. Background start-grace output is formatted the same way.
- `tools/bash.ts` + `tools/spawn.ts` + `shared.ts`: foreground spawns merge
  `FOREGROUND_ENV_OVERRIDES` (`NO_COLOR=1`, `TERM=dumb`, `COLORTERM=`, `PAGER/GIT_PAGER/GH_PAGER=cat`,
  codex-style) over `ctx.getEnv()` so cooperative tools never emit spinner/color frames; background
  (interactive) sessions keep the user's real `TERM`.
- `tools/bash-output.ts`: `bash_output` log-view deltas are sanitized and bounded the same way.

### Why

A single `gh run view --log-failed` returned 999,998 chars (the 1 MB session buffer) straight into
the conversation — context jumped 154k → 404k tokens and forced an emergency compaction; a
`gh pr checks --watch` result was 118k chars of raw spinner frames. Real session evidence:
`--Users-yeongyu-local-workspaces-omo--/2026-07-21T03-07-29-890Z_019f82a4-...` (two compactions
within 15 minutes, both driven by oversized bash results).

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `tools/bash.ts` `runForeground` result construction and `runBackground` early-output block.
- LOW: `tools/bash-output.ts` log-view result construction.
- LOW: `tools/spawn.ts` `SpawnRequest` shape and `manager.create` env merge.

## Core files touched (2026-07-07)

- `core/extensions/builtin/index.ts`: register `terminal` after `bash-timeout`/`anthropic-bash`
  so (a) bash-timeout's injected default reaches PTY `bash`, and (b) mutual-exclusion with
  native Anthropic bash is evaluated after anthropic-bash registers.
- `utils/shell.ts`: `getShellConfig` now honors `SENPI_GIT_BASH_PATH` (Windows-first) and
  resolves an explicit shell path by KIND (`cmd.exe` → `/c`, PowerShell → `-NoProfile -Command`,
  bash/sh → `-c`/`-s`). New exports `resolveShellKind`, `GIT_BASH_PATH_ENV`, `ShellKind`, and a
  `kind` field on `ShellConfig`. See `utils/changes.md`.
- `core/settings-manager.ts`: `TerminalSettings` gains `defaultCols/defaultRows/scrollback/
  maxSessions/timeoutAction/notify` for the terminal tool suite (read via `settings.ts`).
- `core/extensions/builtin/permission-system/parsers.ts`: `bash_input` is gated in the SAME
  `bash` permission class (parsed off its `input` field), so read-only/ask presets are not
  bypassable through a live session. See `permission-system/changes.md`.

## Design decision: mutual exclusion with anthropic-bash

The extension registers a tool named `bash` that overrides core `bash` in the session tool
registry (extension tools override base tools by name in `agent-session._refreshToolRegistry`).
On `session_start` AND `model_select`, `syncToolset` re-evaluates:

- Native Anthropic bash active (`PI_ANTHROPIC_BASH` truthy AND `model.api ===
  "anthropic-messages"`): the four companion tools are DEACTIVATED so none dangle without a
  usable persistent `bash`. anthropic-bash's `before_provider_request` already strips the
  function `bash` from the payload and injects the native `bash_20250124`, so the model uses
  native bash; a one-line `ctx.ui.notify` notice is shown once.
- Otherwise: PTY `bash` + all four companions are (re)activated.

Because extension tools permanently shadow core `bash` by name, a name-toggle cannot recover
the ORIGINAL core `bash` executable once the terminal tool is registered. Rather than add a
core tool-restore API (a larger fork-surface change), the step-aside relies on anthropic-bash's
existing payload sanitization to present native bash to the model; the shadowed PTY `bash` only
executes a native-bash `tool_use` in the rare case one is dispatched, where its foreground path
(command runs; unknown `restart` ignored) is functionally correct. Companion orphaning — the
correctness the plan targets — is fully prevented by deactivation.

## pi-pty note

`packages/pty/src/registry-session.ts` `waitForTerminalSessionExit` was fixed to invoke
`session.waitExit()` via the session object rather than a detached reference, so class-based
sessions (pi-pty `TerminalSession`) keep their `this` binding under `SessionRegistry.stop/
teardown`. Regression test: `packages/pty/test/registry.test.ts`.

## Fast-exit PTY output drain (2026-07-14)

- `crates/senpi-pty/src/session.rs`: synchronous and background waits close the PTY writer/master
  and join the reader before reporting exit, preserving final output from fast-exiting commands.
- `crates/senpi-pty/src/lib.rs`: native data callbacks wait until the JavaScript callback has run,
  preserve callback exceptions, and unblock only when the thread-safe function reports N-API
  environment teardown, so the reader join guarantees delivery without leaking a blocked thread.
- `core/extensions/builtin/terminal/runtime-session.ts`: constructs `TerminalSession` explicitly,
  registers output/exit listeners, then calls `start()` so startup output cannot beat subscription.

This ordering belongs below the extension layer: an extension cannot change native PTY teardown or
subscribe before a session created by the convenience factory has already started. During upstream
merges, preserve the close-writer → close-master → join-reader sequence, the N-API delivery
acknowledgement, and listener-before-start construction. Expected conflict zones are native session
lifecycle code, the N-API `startPtySession` callback, and terminal runtime construction.

## Foreground abort/timeout must release the tool (2026-07-18)

- `tools/bash.ts`: foreground abort now sends one decisive group `SIGKILL` (the pi-pty `kill()` is one-shot
  idempotent, so a first gentle SIGTERM would block escalation and a SIGTERM-ignoring command pinned the agent
  forever). The exit wait is raced against `KILLED_SESSION_EXIT_GRACE_MS` (new in `shared.ts`, 5s) armed on abort
  and on `timeoutMs + grace`: the native wait joins the PTY reader thread, which blocks while any surviving
  descendant (own process group, inherited slave fd) holds the PTY open — previously ESC appeared dead while
  "Running bash" counted up for hours. When the grace releases the wait, the session entry may settle later
  through the registry's own `onExit` subscription (an unkillable holder can keep it `stopping`).
- Aborted foreground runs now report `Command aborted` (core bash parity) instead of `Command exited with code
  137`; timeout-grace releases report the standard `Command timed out after N seconds`.
- A signal already aborted at execute-entry returns `Command aborted` without spawning a session; the
  timeout-grace timer is not armed when `timeoutMs + grace` exceeds the 32-bit `setTimeout` range (no false
  early timeout); on a grace release the tool sweeps the session via `ctx.manager.stop(id)` (fire-and-forget).
- `@earendil-works/pi-pty` `SessionRegistry` gained `stopExitGraceMs` (default 5s): `stop()`/`teardown()` now
  bound their exit wait and mark a never-settling session `stopping` instead of hanging — without this, the
  terminal extension's awaited `manager.teardown()` made `/exit` hang on the same held-open PTY. Residual: a
  `stopping` entry still occupies a registry slot until its exit finally settles (capacity cap 32).
- Regression coverage: `test/terminal-bash-abort.test.ts` (pre-aborted signal spawns nothing, SIGTERM-ignoring
  command, PTY held open across abort and timeout, plain-run pin) and `packages/pty/test/registry.test.ts`
  (bounded stop/teardown on a session that never reports exit).

## Monitor telemetry over extension events (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- `monitor-registry.ts`: live monitor snapshots now carry command/filter/persistence/deadline and fire counters, and each monitor emits one typed ended record with its terminal reason and exit code.
- `extension.ts` and `session-bundle.ts`: publish enriched state and `terminal_monitor_ended` through the existing extension and RPC event channels; replay endings across a parked reload exactly once. Fire-stat refreshes do not trigger manifest writes or wake-source transitions.
- `monitor-notify.ts`, `notify.ts`, and `tools/monitor.ts`: retain monitor details in coalesced `senpi-monitor:notification` custom-message entries, including overflow-only monitors, and capture registration metadata without changing the monitor schema or description. `details` is already accepted and persisted by the custom-message API, so no fallback event or content prefix is needed.
- `durable-command.ts` and `durable-file.ts`: retain command/persistence metadata after restart. `fireCount` counts emitted line and summary events in this registry lifetime, including the final summary; paused/filtered lines are excluded. Existing persistent file-watch lifetime semantics are unchanged.

### Why

- omo-desktop needs complete monitor records, lifecycle history, and monitor ids on each coalesced notification to render runtime details and timeline joins.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The registry owns monitor lifecycle, fire accounting, and terminal exit classification; the builtin terminal extension is the existing event publisher and notification owner.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `monitor-registry.ts` lifecycle and snapshot paths; LOW: `extension.ts`, `session-bundle.ts`, `durable-command.ts`, `durable-file.ts`, `monitor-notify.ts`, `notify.ts`, and `tools/monitor.ts`.
