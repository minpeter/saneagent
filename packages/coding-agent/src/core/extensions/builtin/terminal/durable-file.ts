/**
 * The `checkpointed-file` durability class: the restore handler that makes a persistent file
 * watch survive a restart. On create the monitor tool persists the registry's own identity
 * tuple (dev/ino/size/mtimeMs/digest/present) as the manifest checkpoint; here that checkpoint
 * is compared ONCE against the file as it is now, and any change that happened while the process
 * was gone is reported as EXACTLY ONE line through the registry's normal event sink — so the
 * notifier's coalescing and wake budget apply to it exactly as they do to a live watch event.
 *
 * `digest` is load-bearing: without it a same-size, same-mtime rewrite is invisible across a restart.
