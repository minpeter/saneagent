# builtin/prompt-preset

Builtin extension #7. On `before_agent_start` and `model_select`, picks a system prompt preset by **model family** (gpt-5.x through gpt-5.6, gpt-6-astra, claude-fable-5, claude-fable-5-1, claude-opus-5, claude-opus-4-{5,6,7,8}, glm-5.2, glm-5.3, deepseek-v4-{flash,flash-0731,pro}, kimi-k2-{6,7}, kimi-k3) and falls back to the senpi dynamic prompt when nothing matches. Renders the active preset name in the startup header. After 2026-04-30, presets are thin wrappers around `buildDynamicSystemPrompt()` carrying only model-specific tuning.

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task | File |
|------|------|
| Add a preset for a new model release | new `<family>.ts` + entry in `presets.ts` |
| Tune GPT-5.x file-handling guidance | `file-operations.ts` (all GPT presets append it) |
| Tune GPT-5.6 execution discipline (eval/parallel/TDD/commits/LSP) | `gpt-5.6.ts` `GPT56_EXECUTION_RULES` + `test/suite/prompt-presets-gpt-5-6.test.ts` |
| Tune GPT-6 Astra behavior (initiative/instruction precedence/async work/writing) | `gpt-6-astra.ts` `GPT6_ASTRA_RULES` + `test/suite/prompt-presets-gpt-6-astra.test.ts` |
| Tune the eval-default stance for Claude, GLM, and Kimi presets | `execution-tooling.ts` + `test/suite/prompt-presets-execution-tooling.test.ts` |
| Tune the wait-as-subscription (`tool.monitor`) stance | `senpi-codemode/src/prompt/eval-prompt.ts` (eval tool description), not this directory |
| Tune GLM 5.x behavior | `glm-5.ts` `GLM5_TUNING` (both 5.2 and 5.3 render it) |
| Adjust model-id → preset matching | `presets.ts` `resolvePresetName()` |
| User override via settings | `settings.ts` `PromptPresetName` |

## PRESET SHAPE (post 2026-04-30)

```typescript
function buildGpt55Tuning(): string {
   return `…model-specific addenda…

${buildFileOperationsTuning()}`;
}

export function buildGpt55Prompt(options: BuildDynamicSystemPromptOptions): string {
   return buildDynamicSystemPrompt({ ...options, tuningSection: buildGpt55Tuning() });
}
```

Each preset is ~10 lines. The shared default in `dynamic-prompt/` carries identity, intent gate, exploration, parallel-tools, verification, policies, style. Preset only carries **what's different for that model family**.

Exception: `gpt-5.5.ts`, `gpt-5.6.ts`, `gpt-6-astra.ts`, `kimi-k3.ts`, `claude-fable-5.ts`, and `claude-opus-5.ts` pass `corePrompt` instead of `tuningSection` — full core rewrites (the two Claude 5 presets are dieted per the Fable 5 prompting guide — strong instruction following makes the shared scaffolding over-prescriptive — and carry the binding declared-stop-condition contract) (GPT-5.5+ wants short, outcome-first prompts, not the shared scaffolding; GPT-5.6 additionally over-compresses under generic brevity wording, so its style rules are prioritization/preserve-first, and its core is dieted per its own guide's simplify-first doctrine — previously duplicated rules stated once, probe-audited; Kimi K3 uses the Fable 5.1 skeleton with the boundaries Moonshot's K3 release notes call for — K3's documented failure is excessive proactiveness, acting on minor issues and ambiguous intent instead of asking, so the core states scope, ambiguity, and failure-cap rules once each and drops the K2.6-era act-bias repetition that used to outvote them). The 5.6 core is modeled on the oh-my-opencode Hephaestus GPT-5.6 prompt (autonomous deep worker: implement-don't-propose, Manual QA Gate, failure-recovery circuit breaker, stop rules), minus omo-only tool contracts. They still reuse `buildTestDisciplineSection()` (and, GPT-only, `buildFileOperationsTuning()`) plus the builder's dynamic assembly, so shared rules stay single-sourced.

## CONVENTIONS

- **Model-family naming, not personas**: presets are named after the model they target (`gpt-5.ts`, not `coder.ts`). The 2026-04-30 rename removed persona-style names.
- **`file-operations.ts` is appended to EVERY GPT-5.x preset**. New GPT preset → mirror this. Negative-only directives lose to model priors; pair them with positive routing.
- **`resolvePresetName()` is cheap** (used by startup header). `resolvePreset()` builds the full prompt — call only when needed.
- **Don't duplicate identity / intent / exploration** in a preset — they're already in the default builder. The dieted core (2026-09-02/03) also carries one-plan commitment, scope fidelity, the conditional delegation rule, and the auto-compaction continuation fact — a tuning line that restates any of these is dead weight (2026-09-03 audit removed such lines from every Opus 4.x and GLM preset).
- **A tuning line must be documented for the target model**: cite the guide section (or the preset's own probe evidence) in `changes.md`. A preset whose guide documents nothing beyond the core renders execution tooling only (`claude-opus-4-6.ts`).

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Renaming a preset file to a persona ("coder", "architect", "thinker") — was tried, reverted.
- Embedding full prompt scaffolding in a `tuningSection` — defeats the point of the 2026-04-30 thin-wrapper architecture. A deliberate full rewrite goes through the builder's `corePrompt` override (see `gpt-5.5.ts`), never by duplicating shared sections as tuning text.
- Adding a non-GPT preset that copies `buildFileOperationsTuning()` — the apply_patch routing is GPT-specific.
- Mutating `BuildDynamicSystemPromptOptions` before passing through — pass via spread, add only `tuningSection`.

## NOTES

- Tests under `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/prompt-presets-*.test.ts` validate preset resolution per model-id shape, settings forcing, and catalog coverage; shared tuning text is asserted by shipped-copy equality against the exported constant (`GLM5_TUNING`), never by pinned sentences.
- Prompt-content coverage asserts **parsed rule data**, never pinned sentences (senpi's `prompt-behavior-coverage` test-discipline rule). `prompt-presets-gpt-5-6.test.ts` is the reference shape: ids → concerns, each directive rendered exactly once, and a placement table that fails if a directive drifts out of its owning `## ` section.
- The fork rationale: senpi is a neutral coding agent; persona-named presets collapsed identity into specific personas and made `--model` ↔ active preset hard to reason about. Family naming is the canonical resolution.
- Adding a new model release: copy the closest existing preset, replace the model family in the test, update `presets.ts` matcher, add a regression test.
